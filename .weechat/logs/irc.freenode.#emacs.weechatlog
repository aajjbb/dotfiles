2014-12-09 22:32:19	aidalgol	We were also already following agile practices before this, just without using agile terms.

2014-12-09 22:38:54	aidalgol	turing: No, it's trying to explain a requirement, but from the user standpoint, so that the devs have the user and purpose in mind when looking at it.
2014-12-09 22:38:57	forcer	turing: A first example would be "As a person, I want the floor to exert gravity on me, in order to be able to stand on the floor." The As a/I want/In order to triple is rather typical. As a developer, I would look at that and, for example, be able to ask *why* do you want to stand on the floor, and possibly find a different solution for that use case instead of gravity - or understand better what you mean with "gravity" in case I have

2014-12-09 22:39:57	twb	And on the other end, to turn the engineer babble into customer-intelligible user documentation
2014-12-09 22:40:44	turing	forcer: Ah, I see.
2014-12-09 22:40:45	twb	They need to know some of the customer's job and some of the geek's job
2014-12-09 22:41:10	twb	Aaaaanyway user stories are a way to help the customer articulate what they actually want
2014-12-09 22:41:33	aidalgol	<twb> They need to know some of the customer's job and some of the geek's job <-- we have a group here who does just that
2014-12-09 22:41:40	twb	Because if you just go to the customer and say "what do you need" they will not answer coherently.  They'll forget stuff or consider it obvious.

2014-12-10 20:02:12	pkkm	Bartleby: when you have a lot of configuration, you usually use hooks and `with-eval-after-load' to do things as late as possible, e.g. configuring clojure-mode only when clojure-mode is loaded (which happens when you open a Clojure file), instead of executing code that probably won't be needed on Emacs startup.

2014-12-17 21:36:48	tadni	Everything being said, I am very fearfull for the long-term future of Emacs. But too, regardless where it goes, I'm very happy to have come to use and get familar with it in it's current state. Finding cool, new, and hidden trics really kept me intersted in programming. Sans Emacs, I don't think I would be pursuing programming as a carrer right now.

2014-12-17 23:17:40	tadni	catern: It literally could not if it wanted to, use systemd. A design goal is to support the Hurd. RMS basically said it is needed for it even to be considered officially supported/favored in any way.

2014-12-17 23:19:50	catern	but it's not that useful for freedom
2014-12-17 23:19:55	tadni	But again, RMS wants Hurd support. Which they are working on ... but is a problem, because there are debian centered packages that makes it hard to use stuff like upstream glibc.

2014-12-17 23:21:04	anxt	hurd to me is like going to the gym.  I like the idea, but I don't see myself actually doing anything about it.
2014-12-17 23:21:05	catern	could you find the citation?
2014-12-17 23:21:14	catern	i'd be pretty disappointed in RMS if he said that
2014-12-17 23:21:18	tadni	I mean, this GNUish distro is a bootable thing. I'm running it on linux-libre now.

2014-12-17 23:21:45	anxt	I wonder if glib works on hurd

2014-12-17 23:22:05	catern	why wouldn't it
2014-12-17 23:22:29	catern	why would you especially turn into a glib fanboy because it works on Hurd?
2014-12-17 23:22:34	anxt	well I am probably way out of date, but I thought there were some major things that didn't port to hurd nicely
2014-12-17 23:22:40	tadni	catern: Some low-level stuff are patched to run only with Debian in miind.

2014-12-17 23:30:50	anxt	I started using GNU brace style.  I really like the return type on a function being on a line of its own too.
