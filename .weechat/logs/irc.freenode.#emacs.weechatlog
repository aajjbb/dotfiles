2014-12-09 22:38:54	aidalgol	turing: No, it's trying to explain a requirement, but from the user standpoint, so that the devs have the user and purpose in mind when looking at it.
2014-12-09 22:38:57	forcer	turing: A first example would be "As a person, I want the floor to exert gravity on me, in order to be able to stand on the floor." The As a/I want/In order to triple is rather typical. As a developer, I would look at that and, for example, be able to ask *why* do you want to stand on the floor, and possibly find a different solution for that use case instead of gravity - or understand better what you mean with "gravity" in case I have

2014-12-09 22:39:57	twb	And on the other end, to turn the engineer babble into customer-intelligible user documentation
2014-12-09 22:40:44	turing	forcer: Ah, I see.
2014-12-09 22:40:45	twb	They need to know some of the customer's job and some of the geek's job
2014-12-09 22:41:10	twb	Aaaaanyway user stories are a way to help the customer articulate what they actually want
2014-12-09 22:41:33	aidalgol	<twb> They need to know some of the customer's job and some of the geek's job <-- we have a group here who does just that
2014-12-09 22:41:40	twb	Because if you just go to the customer and say "what do you need" they will not answer coherently.  They'll forget stuff or consider it obvious.

2014-12-10 20:02:12	pkkm	Bartleby: when you have a lot of configuration, you usually use hooks and `with-eval-after-load' to do things as late as possible, e.g. configuring clojure-mode only when clojure-mode is loaded (which happens when you open a Clojure file), instead of executing code that probably won't be needed on Emacs startup.

2014-12-17 21:36:48	tadni	Everything being said, I am very fearfull for the long-term future of Emacs. But too, regardless where it goes, I'm very happy to have come to use and get familar with it in it's current state. Finding cool, new, and hidden trics really kept me intersted in programming. Sans Emacs, I don't think I would be pursuing programming as a carrer right now.

2014-12-17 23:17:40	tadni	catern: It literally could not if it wanted to, use systemd. A design goal is to support the Hurd. RMS basically said it is needed for it even to be considered officially supported/favored in any way.

2014-12-17 23:19:50	catern	but it's not that useful for freedom
2014-12-17 23:19:55	tadni	But again, RMS wants Hurd support. Which they are working on ... but is a problem, because there are debian centered packages that makes it hard to use stuff like upstream glibc.

2014-12-17 23:21:04	anxt	hurd to me is like going to the gym.  I like the idea, but I don't see myself actually doing anything about it.
2014-12-17 23:21:05	catern	could you find the citation?
2014-12-17 23:21:14	catern	i'd be pretty disappointed in RMS if he said that
2014-12-17 23:21:18	tadni	I mean, this GNUish distro is a bootable thing. I'm running it on linux-libre now.

2014-12-17 23:22:05	catern	why wouldn't it
2014-12-17 23:22:29	catern	why would you especially turn into a glib fanboy because it works on Hurd?
2014-12-17 23:22:34	anxt	well I am probably way out of date, but I thought there were some major things that didn't port to hurd nicely
2014-12-17 23:22:40	tadni	catern: Some low-level stuff are patched to run only with Debian in miind.

2014-12-17 23:30:50	anxt	I started using GNU brace style.  I really like the return type on a function being on a line of its own too.

2014-12-18 01:18:07	Pixel_Outlaw	I like writing a function once that takes any kinds of variables. If it blows up running well then I just fix it.
2014-12-18 01:18:21	a7a	with a name like Pixel_Outlaw i would have though you would have been more agressive in, shall we say, finding tv episodes on the web

2014-12-18 01:18:58	Pixel_Outlaw	There isn't much on TV that interests me.
2014-12-18 01:19:06	tadni	I want to say because it was designed by 1/2 of the Dynamic-Unix-Duo, GoLang is going to be amaing. But when I realized Guy Steele did both Scheme and Java, my expectations for someone's design sense to be a universal improvement.

2014-12-18 20:41:05	Pixel_Outlaw	There is a Lisp book that provides a very simple raycaster as an exercise. I assume converting that to elisp would mean writing to a simple image format and loading it into the buffer in X11 mode.

2014-12-19 21:05:05	feurd	Hello there! My question might be too wide, but I'll try : I started learning programming in C++. I just discovered Emacs a few days ago, and I love it so much that I don't want to leave it. I also learnt that you can programm directly in Emacs. But since now, I worked with CodeBlock, which handle all the  things behind (precompiling, compiling, etc). How can I set up things in order to write and compile my code with emacs?

2014-12-19 21:13:47	bpalmer	feurd: a typical experience on a linux distribution is to install gcc and/or g++, and then you would compile a single file 'file.cc' with a command like 'g++ -o file file.cc'
2014-12-19 21:14:04	tadni_	But, Emacsy was a Guile project to Emulate Emacs like functionality in a kind of toolkit.

2014-12-19 21:14:24	bpalmer	feurd: there are fancier ways to get emacs to automatically issue that command for you (or run another tool which issues commands for you)

2014-12-19 21:15:08	bpalmer	feurd: but conceptually, for small modern programs, it's just about that easy. When you're dealing with large, or old, or both, stuff gets more complicated.
2014-12-19 21:15:16	ijp	dataangel: yeah, but kensanata hasn't been on
2014-12-19 21:15:19	tadni_	But yeah, as ijp said -- not too surprising not much came out of it. I just forgot it was a thing till it randomly just popped into my head.

2014-12-19 21:15:22	rudybot	ijp: kensanata was seen in #emacs one day ago, saying "Looks like I'm getting the new Emacs Wiki site.", and then kensanata was seen quitting one day ago, saying "Ping timeout: 245 seconds"
2014-12-19 21:16:36	tadni_	Emacsy was never tied in with Guix, and a formal GNU System. It was an experimental side project that started and mostly ended before Guix even started.
2014-12-19 21:16:51	tadni_	And I mean, side, side project.
2014-12-19 21:17:06	ijp	hmm, the amount people talk about a project vs how much they know about it seems like a quartic function
2014-12-19 21:17:14	tadni_	It wasn't even a GNU Project that I'm aware of any notable Guile hacker.
2014-12-19 21:17:27	feurd	bpalmer, Ok, I'll have a look at these g** things. I thought (maybe naively) that somehow I could configure Emacs to simply do the trick of compiling my cpp files, just as it does it for my LaTeX files, so I can use the same programm for everything. But it seems that for programming, it requires a knowledge I don't have

2014-12-19 21:21:32	feurd	bpalmer, If I understand you properly, g++ is kind of the equivalent of TexLive in the hierarchy?
2014-12-19 21:22:04	tadni_	ijp: Attack is a bit strong, but wasamasa made an accusational statement. 
2014-12-19 21:22:09	bpalmer	feurd: TeXLive is a distribution of packages + the latex/pdflatex/tex programs, so that corresponds , I guess, to the gcc suite.

2014-12-19 21:23:58	feurd	bpalmer, Oh yeah right. I see the difference. g++ would be the 'brain' (= tex compiler) and gcc the additionnal stuff (TexLive) ? Sorry for the approximative terminology...
2014-12-19 21:24:50	wasamasa	feurd: well, that would only be right if you refer to gcc, the project
2014-12-19 21:25:11	bpalmer	feurd: it's a little bit overloaded. g++ would be like the tex compiler (for c++). gcc is like the tex compiler (for c). but gcc is also the name of the project, like TeX

2014-12-19 21:53:07	chrisdone	Haste is somewhere in between. i haven't used it, but AIUI it compiles from the STG like ghcjs, but doesn't try to be ghc so it doesn't have a threading runtime or support System.IO etc. its runtime is more like fay's and its output is small

But once I switched to Emacs, I wanted to process all my text in Emacs.  Shopped about.  Settled on Wanderlust. Now, I'd say that is the best I've ever used.

2014-12-26 12:17:48	finster	i think let won't suffice as it does not survive the function call, setq would be more appropriate. but maybe i'll go this route
2014-12-26 12:18:08	finster	or maybe i can set a buffer-local variable
2014-12-26 12:18:49	ejmr	Do you have the code or an example to share?  It'd be easier to help if I could see the code.

2014-12-29 02:50:42	xn`	And according to the readme, if that happens, it's usually an issue with the config. There are apparently some workarounds for it but I'd rather get the issue solved in the config to prevent any other problems later on.

2014-12-29 21:01:07	nicferrier	and I think gnus is touted these days more as a mail reader.

2014-12-29 21:02:51	wgreenhouse	nicferrier: we do. and those of us who like Gnus don't just tolerate it because it's a barely-working proof of concept of an Emacs mailer. we use it because it's "right" for us.

2014-12-29 21:03:13	cluck	only this newsreader is actually an Omnipotent communication tool that does news, email, feeds, shinbum, webpages(if you're like rms ;) and let's be honest the only reason it doesn't do IM is because the old timers hate or else we'd be doing irc over gnus and you all know it

2014-12-29 21:09:26	tastycode	I’m brand new to emacs. I’m using helm-projectile to find files, i’ve found that this only works exactly once. If i start emacs in ~/workspace/myproject.. then use helm-find to fuzzy autocomplete a search for ~/workspace/myproject/some/deep/directory/file.rb .. then a subsequent use of helm-find, will not search through the tree in ~/workspace/myproject/… it almost seems as though the cwd has been changed to  
2014-12-29 21:09:26	tastycode	~/workspace/myproject/some/deep/directory/.. executing “pwd” from emacs context confirms this.  In vim, i’m used to the working directory being sort of “locked” to the directory i invoked vim from.. how do i adjust to emacs in this regard?

2014-12-29 21:19:43	emacsomancer00	gotwf: for lots of things, folders make sense - I want to know what's in my INBOX, what's not in my inbox but is not binned/spam (i.e. Archived), but then for other things it makes sense to have a more granular approach
2014-12-29 21:19:53	nicferrier	bpalmer: my point holds.
2014-12-29 21:20:07	wgreenhouse	tastycode: as that will (probably) be expanded to the current value of default-directory in the buffer where you run the command
2014-12-29 21:20:24	bpalmer	oh, and threaded Summary displays.
2014-12-29 21:20:26	gotwf	tastycode: If you've just started using Emacs, you may want to get the feel of plain vanilla before you start employing something like Helm, wh/is fairly drastic departure from trad Emacs way of doing things.  No value judgment +/-, just less confusion for newbie
2014-12-29 21:20:32	bpalmer	Now those, those I miss the most.
2014-12-29 21:20:33	nicferrier	in fairness it's hard to write a good mailer in emacs because no threads, so very hard to do indexing.

2014-12-29 22:24:45	gotwf	Doesn't mbsync keep your maildir sync'd both directions?  Dovecot seems to be extra and unnecessary complexity just to run on personal box.
2014-12-29 22:25:03	parsnip	I think one reason that may be relevant to me is that Gnus with Maildir can be tricky.
