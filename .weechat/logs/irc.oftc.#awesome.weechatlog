2014-12-26 18:02:44	ttucker	Perhaps I just need to read the code... *** sigh *** :)
2014-12-26 18:06:30	ttucker	To answer my own question... After checking out the source for wibox.widget.textbox, I found that it calls a set_markup (potentially) and that it accepts "Pango" markup - http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/pango-markup-language.html
2014-12-26 18:06:47	ttucker	This ***should*** allow me to style these textboxes.
2014-12-26 18:08:45	ttucker	Well, I got it to not error ... but it still doesn't work :(
2014-12-26 18:09:42	ttucker	This might be because the vicious widget is setting the background color after I define the textbox...
2014-12-26 18:10:44	<--	bolt (r00t@178.74.28.62) has quit (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
2014-12-26 18:11:15	ttucker	OK... I was correct... Vicious is setting the background color afterwards ... The Pango markup works on non-vicicous widgets...

2014-12-26 18:37:08	ttucker	Anyone have ideas about using images for tag names?
2014-12-26 18:39:45	tdy	did you have specific images in mind, or just wanted something different?
2014-12-26 18:40:09	tdy	if the latter, this is one option: http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Symbolic_tag_names
2014-12-26 18:46:42	ttucker	awesome tdy!
2014-12-26 18:46:59	ttucker	I am trying to do a couple of things... One is using images for tag names...

2014-12-26 18:47:28	ttucker	But in addition to that I am try to add an image as the background for the layout boxes...
2014-12-26 18:47:44	ttucker	I was able to get the gradients to work, just not images...

2014-12-26 18:48:31	ttucker	Not just different than numbers.
2014-12-26 18:54:01	tdy	pretty sure all these things are possible, but i'm just not familiar enough with the API
2014-12-26 18:54:50	tdy	elv13 is one of the "super theme customizers" you asked about. he's not showing up in my recent logs though.. weird

2014-12-26 19:06:45	ttucker	I think that is a bug...
2014-12-26 19:07:07	ttucker	... I almost feel like I asked about this before and someone told me that gears was going away ... or something.
2014-12-26 19:14:41	ctw	I'm trying to achieve this: http://imgur.com/2j0LSUS in xterm, any ideas?

2014-12-26 19:18:48	ttucker	ctw: Archlinux has amazing documentation. Actually, I switched to Archlinux after months of the Archlinux wiki having the answers to all my questions.
2014-12-26 19:19:05	ttucker	basically setting PS1 is what you want...
2014-12-26 19:19:27	ttucker	Also, check out PROMPT_COMMAND - you can do really neat things, such as read the return code of the last command you ran...
2014-12-26 19:21:43	ttucker	ctw - Also, if you want ... check out urxvt - This is a very very good terminal emulator and it has perl extensions ... So, you can do like auto highlighting based on a pattern (I use it for stuff like auto grabbing session id's out of maillog - I am in the email security business)
2014-12-26 19:22:07	ttucker	Also, grabbing URLs... changing the font size with hot keys.
