2014-12-26 18:06:47	ttucker	This ***should*** allow me to style these textboxes.
2014-12-26 18:08:45	ttucker	Well, I got it to not error ... but it still doesn't work :(
2014-12-26 18:09:42	ttucker	This might be because the vicious widget is setting the background color after I define the textbox...
2014-12-26 18:10:44	<--	bolt (r00t@178.74.28.62) has quit (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
2014-12-26 18:11:15	ttucker	OK... I was correct... Vicious is setting the background color afterwards ... The Pango markup works on non-vicicous widgets...

2014-12-26 18:37:08	ttucker	Anyone have ideas about using images for tag names?
2014-12-26 18:39:45	tdy	did you have specific images in mind, or just wanted something different?
2014-12-26 18:40:09	tdy	if the latter, this is one option: http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Symbolic_tag_names
2014-12-26 18:46:42	ttucker	awesome tdy!
2014-12-26 18:46:59	ttucker	I am trying to do a couple of things... One is using images for tag names...

2014-12-26 18:47:28	ttucker	But in addition to that I am try to add an image as the background for the layout boxes...
2014-12-26 18:47:44	ttucker	I was able to get the gradients to work, just not images...

2014-12-26 18:48:31	ttucker	Not just different than numbers.
2014-12-26 18:54:01	tdy	pretty sure all these things are possible, but i'm just not familiar enough with the API
2014-12-26 18:54:50	tdy	elv13 is one of the "super theme customizers" you asked about. he's not showing up in my recent logs though.. weird

2014-12-26 19:06:45	ttucker	I think that is a bug...
2014-12-26 19:07:07	ttucker	... I almost feel like I asked about this before and someone told me that gears was going away ... or something.
2014-12-26 19:14:41	ctw	I'm trying to achieve this: http://imgur.com/2j0LSUS in xterm, any ideas?

2014-12-26 19:18:48	ttucker	ctw: Archlinux has amazing documentation. Actually, I switched to Archlinux after months of the Archlinux wiki having the answers to all my questions.
2014-12-26 19:19:05	ttucker	basically setting PS1 is what you want...
2014-12-26 19:19:27	ttucker	Also, check out PROMPT_COMMAND - you can do really neat things, such as read the return code of the last command you ran...
2014-12-26 19:21:43	ttucker	ctw - Also, if you want ... check out urxvt - This is a very very good terminal emulator and it has perl extensions ... So, you can do like auto highlighting based on a pattern (I use it for stuff like auto grabbing session id's out of maillog - I am in the email security business)
2014-12-26 19:22:07	ttucker	Also, grabbing URLs... changing the font size with hot keys.

2014-12-30 22:31:48	konni	gammaleak: by default new windows are set as 'master'
2014-12-30 22:32:20	konni	gammaleak: by uncommenting line 379 in the 3.5 rc.lua: awful.client.setslave(c), you can make them appear as slave windows
2014-12-30 22:33:06	konni	the layouts usually consist of one large master window and 1-to-N slave windows... 
2014-12-30 22:33:41	konni	(you can increase/decrease the number of master windows with a keybind then... but thats the default)
2014-12-30 22:34:27	gammaleak	I should probably say that I'm on 3.4 (that's what Debian stable has).
2014-12-30 22:34:44	gammaleak	But I think that master/slave concept is in 3.4 as well (I saw it somewhere).
2014-12-30 22:35:13	gammaleak	This is really only my second or third day using awesome, and I've mostly stuck to the floating layout (the first one that loads).
2014-12-30 22:35:49	gammaleak	I'm guessing that your recommendation has other implications. For instance, if windows normally open as "master" do they become the "bigger" window in some layouts and push the current one off to the side (to be smaller)?
2014-12-30 22:36:17	gammaleak	And if I make them open as slave, will they then open as smaller windows off to the side instead (again, in certain layouts)?

2014-12-30 22:52:23	konni	you see the icons in the tiling layout...
2014-12-30 22:52:42	konni	e.g. one large area left, 3 smaller areas stacked on the right
2014-12-30 22:52:58	konni	that is an example of 1 master, 3 slave windows
2014-12-30 22:53:39	gammaleak	konni: Right. That's what I thought. So the if you change new windows to open as slaves, they'll be the little ones, not the big one.
2014-12-30 22:54:02	konni	and you can easily swap windows... mod+ctrl+return swaps the current slave with master
2014-12-30 22:54:26	konni	so if you have some slaves for output, one master to 'work' and you need to work in another, focus it, swap with master
2014-12-30 22:54:48	gammaleak	good keybinding to know!
2014-12-30 22:55:05	konni	i migrated to 'directional keybinds' so i hardly use that one
2014-12-30 22:55:29	konni	like 'focus the window to  the left', 'swap with the window above', etc
2014-12-30 22:55:40	konni	but i did use it frequently before 
2014-12-30 22:56:54	konni	there are plenty of keybinds that help navigating around... takes some time to get used to them
2014-12-30 22:57:50	gammaleak	Yup, and doing is pprobably the best way to learn. :)
2014-12-30 22:58:12	konni	exactly
2014-12-30 22:58:46	konni	the default keybinds are pretty good already
2014-12-30 22:59:08	konni	of course you will eventually change some...
2014-12-30 22:59:46	gammaleak	I did add one already: mod+s to make something sticky. I've usually got a YouTube playlist going on while I do stuff.

2014-12-30 23:00:47	konni	you can also display multiple tags
2014-12-30 23:01:08	konni	like 'pull over your youtube video-tag and quickly hide it again'
2014-12-30 23:01:22	konni	mod+ctrl+# 
2014-12-30 23:02:08	gammaleak	Yeah, I knew about that feature, but hadn't learned that keybind yet. That would be another way to do it. Maybe a better way even. I'm not sure yet. :)
2014-12-30 23:02:09	konni	i'm fond of the scratch-pad... having a window you can show/hide on all workspaces
2014-12-30 23:02:20	konni	depends on the situation
2014-12-30 23:02:27	gammaleak	right, and your personal workflow
2014-12-30 23:04:56	konni	depending on your distribution, upgrading to 3.5 may be a good idea... you will need to start with a fresh config and may not want to customize it all again
2014-12-30 23:06:10	gammaleak	I haven't done much with the current one, and certainly nothing I couldn't easily recreate.
2014-12-30 23:07:02	gammaleak	It looks like Debian Wheezy (my distro) only has 3.4. Even the backports repository doesn't have 3.5
2014-12-30 23:09:03	konni	debian... okay
2014-12-30 23:09:09	konni	its somewhere in unstable/experimental
2014-12-30 23:11:24	gammaleak	Probably so. I've messed around with thos repos before, but I just did a big re-install (part of my switch to awesome) and I've resolved to stick to stable and a few limited backports as needed.

2015-01-02 18:05:17	vals_	ehm
2015-01-02 18:06:20	vals_	spyroboy: my base problem is applications that do not support hidpi natively, which sadly includes the vast majority of java applications as well as a bunch of other stuff, both closed and open source
2015-01-02 18:06:32	spyroboy	?
2015-01-02 18:06:33	spyroboy	no
2015-01-02 18:06:34	spyroboy	I mean
2015-01-02 18:06:37	spyroboy	why do you need to zoom?
2015-01-02 18:06:41	spyroboy	is it too small?
2015-01-02 18:06:52	vals_	spyroboy: to make the app usable even when the display is at maximum resolution
2015-01-02 18:07:19	vals_	I have a 15" 3200x1800 display. anything that doesn't "know" hidpi comes up with a ridiculously unreadable UI
2015-01-02 18:08:36	konni	you can change the dpi with xrandr...
2015-01-02 18:08:53	konni	but not per app, just per xsession
2015-01-02 18:13:48	spyroboy	lol
2015-01-02 18:13:57	spyroboy	you should change it per xsession
2015-01-02 18:14:37	vals_	konni: changing the dpi is not the problem
2015-01-02 18:14:47	vals_	konni: I'd need to physically reduce the resolution
2015-01-02 18:14:51	vals_	which is a PITN
2015-01-02 18:15:27	konni	mhhm.. i have a 14" fhd notebook, docked, 2x 24" fhd screens... wish i could increase dpi on just the notebook ;) 
2015-01-02 18:15:40	konni	because if i do, apps get 'bigger'
2015-01-02 18:15:54	konni	with full resolution that is
2015-01-02 18:16:19	konni	(or decrease... not at work right now to check history)
2015-01-02 18:16:29	vals_	ah, different-dpi is one of those things that won't be fixed by wayland either 8-D
2015-01-02 18:17:03	vals_	actually, I'm thinking that one possible solution would be to put crappy apps in a specific tag and make awesome switch to a lowe resolution whenever I switch to that tab
2015-01-02 18:17:06	vals_	would that work?
2015-01-02 18:17:24	konni	ah i dont really use the laptop anyway... cant focus on 3 screens properly, sometimes open some layout or stuff on it but its mostly unused
2015-01-02 18:17:48	konni	i'm still not convinced why changing dpi does not help

2015-01-02 18:21:35	konni	the apps even stay that way after changing dpi again
2015-01-02 18:21:48	konni	change dpi; launch old app; revert dpi change
2015-01-02 18:22:10	konni	but i probably just didnt understand the exact problem

2015-01-02 18:28:26	vals_	konni: your terminal application (which one is it, btw?) is dpi aware
2015-01-02 18:28:32	vals_	now try josm, for example

2015-01-02 18:33:46	vals_	konni: so yeah, you'll notice that a LOT of applications are dpi-unaware
2015-01-02 18:34:04	vals_	qt is usually decently fine, except where developers hard-coded icon sizes in pixels
2015-01-02 18:34:10	konni	brr...
2015-01-02 18:34:22	vals_	gtk is also steadly improving, at least for 3.14, but again, depends
2015-01-02 18:34:26	konni	ok now i get the actual problem... 
2015-01-02 18:34:37	vals_	but most applications simply suck
2015-01-02 18:34:39	konni	and i considered a 4k screen some time...
2015-01-02 18:34:44	konni	guess that will wait
2015-01-02 18:35:05	vals_	oh I love my hidpi monitor, and I've submitted patches to stuff like libreoffice, subsurface, and firefox to improve support it
2015-01-02 18:35:14	konni	hehe okay...
2015-01-02 18:35:27	vals_	but I cannot single-handedly fix everything, so I need a way to manage unfixed applications in the mean time
2015-01-02 18:35:35	konni	sure, thats too much 
2015-01-02 18:35:38	vals_	and some way to scale the window would help
2015-01-02 18:35:54	konni	fixing frameworks is probably a nice work/gain ratio, but single java apps
2015-01-02 18:36:11	vals_	saying "this application will believe it has a 1024x768 window, but in the real world it will be twice that much in each direction"
2015-01-02 18:36:17	konni	compton 'could' do it
2015-01-02 18:36:33	konni	but its not going to happen soon, at least i found a bugreport on that

2015-01-09 19:36:17	trollixx	psychon: Yes, but I prefer not to touch that at the moment. It's just the simplest way to support global hot keys across different platforms.
2015-01-09 19:36:42	trollixx	libqxt is abandoned anyway
2015-01-09 19:36:56	psychon	on the first meta+z it claimed to show the window, so it doesn't know its current state
2015-01-09 19:37:10	psychon	but yeah, I can reproduce
2015-01-09 19:38:19	psychon	heh, my patch almost works :D
2015-01-09 19:38:47	trollixx	I don't like that 'almost'.
2015-01-09 19:40:03	trollixx	And then I'll tell you about the second problem about window active state. :)

2015-01-09 19:43:17	psychon	well, my patch puts the window into a state that nothing else in awesome expects or handles correctly
2015-01-09 19:43:45	psychon	at least unminimizing via the mod+z works after some minor change, unminimizing by clicking on the tasklist is still broken
2015-01-09 19:43:50	psychon	in other news, X11 is ugly :(
2015-01-09 19:44:16	psychon	but now I have the "almost" due to: minimizing only works sometimes, because the window only sometimes considers itself to have the input focus
2015-01-09 19:45:39	trollixx	psychon: http://pastebin.com/agPYfPbp here's the test case for the window state problem. isWindowActive() often returns false, while it's active in fact
2015-01-09 19:45:58	psychon	want a nopaste of the output of your test-program? it has the same problem
2015-01-09 19:46:35	psychon	trollixx: http://sprunge.us/jWQC
2015-01-09 19:46:43	psychon	is that the same issue?

2015-01-09 19:47:05	trollixx	Ah, yes. It's just more noticable with show/hide
2015-01-09 19:47:47	trollixx	It can return false for isWindowActive() many times and then finally return true
2015-01-09 19:48:51	trollixx	At least now I know that it's not a bug in my app :)

2015-01-09 20:10:31	psychon	right now I'm trying to figure out the focus thingie
2015-01-09 20:10:42	psychon	no idea about that minimized one :(
2015-01-09 20:11:08	trollixx	:(
2015-01-09 20:11:17	psychon	well, I know the technical reasons why it's broken
2015-01-09 20:11:24	psychon	I just don't know how to fix it
2015-01-09 20:13:17	trollixx	So, both problems are not easy to solve...
2015-01-09 20:14:02	psychon	still trying to figure out the focus problem
2015-01-09 20:14:32	psychon	there is a program called xtrace (if you want to google: x11trace, there is something else with the same name) that prints all X11 events / requests / responses on a connection
2015-01-09 20:14:51	psychon	I ran your test app under this and I am now trying to figure out the difference between the working and non-working case

2015-01-09 20:38:11	psychon	I always use --relative-timestamps, that helps a bit to figure out where to look
2015-01-09 20:38:12	trollixx	What I don't get, why it reacts to key presses even when the window is not active
2015-01-09 20:38:16	psychon	but the result still doesn't help me
2015-01-09 20:38:32	trollixx	because of global shortcut maybe...
2015-01-09 20:38:32	psychon	some GrabKey request
2015-01-09 20:38:51	psychon	that gets key input even if "your" window is not focused
2015-01-09 20:41:07	psychon	I go back to ignoring this focus "issue" for now
2015-01-09 20:42:01	trollixx	to fixing minimisation problem?
2015-01-09 20:43:12	psychon	qt considers itself focused on any FocusIn event or if it gets a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message for that window
2015-01-09 20:43:50	psychon	unfocused when the window is destroyed or some FocusOut event
2015-01-09 20:44:04	psychon	however, the focus out thing does some weird magic...
2015-01-09 20:44:23	psychon	that magic tries to figure out if another FocusIn event is already on the way
2015-01-09 20:45:36	psychon	good luck with the x11trace output and figuring out what is wrong ;)
2015-01-09 20:55:22	trollixx	It's interesting how my app gets keyboard input while it is minimised.
2015-01-09 20:55:43	trollixx	I can type something, and then see it if I deminimise the window with mouse click
2015-01-09 20:56:50	psychon	...what?
2015-01-09 20:57:46	psychon	that shouldn't happen, I guess

2015-01-10 14:26:40	psychon	big memory usage and something important is swapped out?
2015-01-10 14:26:44	psychon	dunno
2015-01-10 14:26:58	psychon	in other news, I am trying to split up naughty into naughty.core and naughty.dbus... what a mess :(
2015-01-10 14:27:12	blueyed	tried it with "swapoff -a" already.
2015-01-10 14:28:00	psychon	awesome complains about a slow main loop iteration on stdout?
2015-01-10 14:28:14	psychon	if not, then this might be the X11 server...
2015-01-10 14:28:19	psychon	but sorry, I don't have any good ideas
2015-01-10 14:28:52	blueyed	The last one is: W: awesome: a_glib_poll:230: Last main loop iteration took 1.124003 seconds! Increasing limit for this warning to that value.
2015-01-10 14:29:18	psychon	that's about one second
2015-01-10 14:29:20	blueyed	I will try to comment the code that increases the value and see if I get the warning on lags then every time.
2015-01-10 14:29:27	psychon	so it's really something in awesome taking too long :(
2015-01-10 14:29:38	psychon	beware, that might spam your logs!
2015-01-10 14:29:59	psychon	you should increment the initial value then, e.g. to 0.75
2015-01-10 14:30:10	blueyed	yep. I've seen such long loop iterations before, but not constantly when switching clients e.g.
2015-01-10 14:31:07	psychon	btw I'm trying to split up naughty because of you
2015-01-10 14:31:21	psychon	you could then create an empty file ~/.config/awesome/naughty/dbus.lua
2015-01-10 14:33:06	blueyed	While it's nice it wouldn't be required - the hack now seems to work again.
2015-01-10 14:33:40	psychon	well, it would force us to have a "proper" API
2015-01-10 14:33:45	psychon	right now it has way too many dbus-specific hacks
2015-01-10 14:33:53	psychon	and the dbus part of it is getting too long
2015-01-10 14:34:37	blueyed	And I am seeing "1.075876 seconds" just when "mod4-j/k"'ing two clients on one tag after 20-30 iterations (mod4-k).
2015-01-10 14:40:43	blueyed	It does not happen with the default rc.lua though. I'm investigating.
2015-01-10 14:41:41	psychon	you could use the lua dbus API to get a callback "all the time"
2015-01-10 14:42:19	psychon	in that you could so $MAGIC to get a current timestamp, and if this is at least some_global_timestamp + 0.5, print a backtrace and update the global timestamp
2015-01-10 14:42:33	psychon	your logs will be messy, but this could server as a "poor man's breakpoint" to have some code to blame

2015-01-15 20:23:44	spyroboy	psychon, hate to message you directly
2015-01-15 20:23:54	spyroboy	but I have a question regarding how awesome determines what display a window is on
2015-01-15 20:24:07	spyroboy	typically it only matters when the window is floating
2015-01-15 20:24:21	spyroboy	but it appears that wherever the top left pixel is, it assumes that the window is on that display
2015-01-15 20:24:48	spyroboy	is there a way to make it only move a window to a new display if the cursor drags over to the new window?
2015-01-15 20:24:59	spyroboy	as opposed to the top left corner
2015-01-15 20:25:25	spyroboy	since I find that a lot of times I'm accidentally moving a window to a display even though I merely just wanted to quickly move a window around

2015-01-25 17:43:23	Fluor	iirc 3.5 isn't in ubuntu.
2015-01-25 17:43:47	Fluor	so my first guess would be your rc.lua isn't correct.
2015-01-25 17:44:15	Fluor	do you have local naughty = require("naughty") in your rc file?
2015-01-25 17:44:29	Fluor	or just require("naughty") ?

2015-01-25 17:59:06	retreti	But I'm checking my rc.lua
2015-01-25 17:59:11	Fluor	see http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Awesome_3.4_to_3.5
2015-01-25 18:00:43	Fluor	also, if you still have awesome-extra package installed from ubuntu repos it *might* clash with your 'manual' installed version. you might want to check that too.

2015-02-08 14:26:26	pazz	hi! I have a question regarding the tyrannical setup:
2015-02-08 14:26:57	pazz	is it possible that there is an error in the example.rc? so the problem is with the "tags" variable
2015-02-08 14:27:15	pazz	I'm trying to force my browser to always the same tag
2015-02-08 14:27:49	pazz	but since tags are dynamically created by tyrannical, there is no global "tags" variable
2015-02-08 14:29:15	pazz	so the awful.rules entry that sets 
2015-02-08 14:29:20	pazz	tag = tags[1][2]
2015-02-08 14:29:25	pazz	does not really work
2015-02-08 14:29:45	pazz	it is part of the tyrannical example setup though (albeit commented out)
2015-02-08 14:30:24	pazz	Elv1313: are you Elv13 on github (tyrannicals maintainer) ?

2015-02-08 18:47:28	maruchan	i have a hidpi monitor and a regular dpi monitor, can i set the dpi's independently so font's are bigger on one (the hidpi) than the other
2015-02-08 18:47:44	maruchan	i think i can do it with 2 separate DISPLAY's entirely
2015-02-08 18:47:56	maruchan	but would like to be able to move windows between and move the mouse cursor between monitors

2015-02-08 18:58:21	Fluor	maruchan, i dont think you can with one X-server running on both screens.
2015-02-08 18:58:35	Fluor	maruchan, however you could run two X-servers and 'link the desktops', iirc.
2015-02-08 18:58:51	maruchan	Fluor: hey man
2015-02-08 18:59:07	maruchan	so 2 separate X servers, how would i 'link' the desktops though?

2015-02-08 18:59:24	Fluor	you'd have to google for the more-specifics, but it is possible.e
2015-02-08 18:59:42	maruchan	basically, i think i shouldn't have gotten the 2560x1440 x1 carbon laptop and just went with the 1920x1080 so my DPI's would pretty much match across screens
2015-02-08 18:59:49	maruchan	hmm
2015-02-08 18:59:52	Fluor	:)
2015-02-08 19:00:08	maruchan	im seriously astounded at how little support there is for hidpi
2015-02-08 19:00:15	maruchan	seems the only way is to go OS X
2015-02-08 19:00:18	maruchan	which won't fly with me
2015-02-08 19:00:31	Fluor	it's rather new, right. uhd displays and all..
2015-02-08 19:00:38	maruchan	yeah
2015-02-08 19:00:43	maruchan	but i don't know how they're going to get around it
2015-02-08 19:00:54	maruchan	i think there are fairly serious design decisions that have to be made
2015-02-08 19:01:02	maruchan	dunno if i want to wait it out
2015-02-08 19:02:07	maruchan	Fluor: having trouble finding an answer to your proposal
2015-02-08 19:02:42	maruchan	gonna check in #xorg
2015-02-08 19:03:55	Fluor	hm. i'm fairly certain it should be possible.
2015-02-08 19:04:12	Fluor	although i'm also having a hard time finding the correct keywords to google
2015-02-08 19:04:50	Fluor	that's because there's so much stuff about twinview/dualscreen setups, and this specific tidbit is a very specific tidbit, i guess. ;)

2015-02-11 21:14:18	blueyed	ezekiel: or you can define your own function there, and then look at c.name.
2015-02-11 21:14:23	ezekiel	a new rule, you mean? because that filter statement is already within a rule, the all clients match rule.
2015-02-11 21:15:21	ezekiel	would my new rule need a callback function, or would "properties = { focus = false }" ensure that matching windows are never focused?
2015-02-11 21:15:57	<--	wicope (~usuario@237.74.134.37.dynamic.jazztel.es) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2015-02-11 21:16:13	blueyed	focus=false should work.
2015-02-11 21:16:22	blueyed	FWIW, here is my function: https://gist.github.com/blueyed/ffe106027f44420be6a3
2015-02-11 21:16:25	ezekiel	or maybe it would need "focus = nil", since the docs say that awful.client.focus.filter returns nil if not okay
2015-02-11 21:17:18	blueyed	It doesn't really matter probably, but then the property is different from the function anyway.
2015-02-11 21:17:25	blueyed	Is this for Firefox by any chance?
2015-02-11 21:17:47	ezekiel	nah - it's for an on-screen keyboard application in a kiosk setup
2015-02-11 21:18:24	ezekiel	thanks for your gist!
2015-02-11 21:18:26	blueyed	ok, because Firefox can be nasty - e.g. wanting to be raised after a page reloads etc.
2015-02-11 21:18:31	blueyed	you're welcome.
2015-02-11 21:18:41	blueyed	Elv1313: what's your opinion on https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/pull/101?
2015-02-11 21:20:18	Elv1313	blueyed: for #104, Gio is much better than lua FS and is (almost) already an awesome dependency
2015-02-11 21:20:48	Elv1313	blueyed: it just need to love to wrap it in an usable API, see https://github.com/Elv13/awesome-configs/blob/master/utils/fd_async.lua
2015-02-11 21:22:08	Elv1313	about #101, yes, it is nicer, but some layout support gaps and not other (floating), so i am not sure how to handle that. I am also against looping again for the gaps, those functions are called often, looping is expensive
2015-02-11 21:24:14	blueyed	Ah, I've seen the fd_async stuff already. It does not have checks for existence checking yet, does it?  How would you use it there?
2015-02-11 21:24:39	Elv1313	in that case, I use lua.io like you
2015-02-11 21:24:39	blueyed	Or would you rather just use the icon stuff from it, instead of the "is_readable" code?!
2015-02-11 21:24:55	Elv1313	a check is fast enough, the problem in that PR is at it also read the file
2015-02-11 21:24:58	Elv1313	(part of it)
2015-02-11 21:25:20	Elv1313	that cause a second IO interupt and that one can be slow on 4200rpm hard drives (>100ms)
2015-02-11 21:25:28	Elv1313	causing awesome to lock
2015-02-11 21:25:47	Elv1313	if I do ctrl+p on my old wrok laptop, awesome feeze for 10 seconds
2015-02-11 21:25:52	blueyed	yes, it's a nasty hack.  therefore I've thought that LFS would have some method for it.
2015-02-11 21:25:55	Elv1313	(so everything freeze)
2015-02-11 21:26:20	Elv1313	gio have
2015-02-11 21:26:30	Elv1313	even an async one, but it is overkill
2015-02-11 21:26:40	Elv1313	(for that particular case)
2015-02-11 21:26:56	Elv1313	so I don't mind merging this as is. This method will always be synchronous
2015-02-11 21:27:41	Elv1313	but in the long run, we should remove all sync methods that cuase io interupts from awful API and disable lua.io
2015-02-11 21:27:54	ezekiel	weird, still taking focus, even with "focus = false" in the properties
2015-02-11 21:28:13	Elv1313	Aweosme is single threaded, everytime you make a sync call, awesome freeze, those add up eventually
2015-02-11 21:28:33	Elv1313	ezekiel: focusable=false ?

2015-02-11 21:30:42	blueyed	no, it should be "focus"
2015-02-11 21:31:11	Elv1313	do onscreen keyboards need focus?
2015-02-11 21:31:18	ezekiel	yeah, neither of them work in the properties
2015-02-11 21:31:48	ezekiel	I hope to answer that question once I successfully prevent it from taking focus :)
2015-02-11 21:32:07	ezekiel	it always stays on top - and that's appropriate
2015-02-11 21:32:42	blueyed	ezekiel: there might be also the "request::activate" signal being involved.. try to override/change the default.
2015-02-11 21:32:48	Elv1313	according to https://awesome.naquadah.org/doc/api/modules/client.html focusable exist and should work.
2015-02-11 21:33:03	Elv1313	isn't request::activate only in master?
2015-02-11 21:33:47	blueyed	ezekiel: https://gist.github.com/021f1415eb496e8b3721
2015-02-11 21:33:59	blueyed	oh, maybe.
2015-02-11 21:34:01	ezekiel	holy jesus
2015-02-11 21:34:50	ecormier	hey, does anyone know if it's possible to make a window urgent make a sound in awesome, I have irssi running over ssh, and I'd like to get audio notification on terminal window activity
2015-02-11 21:35:03	blueyed	it's work in progress.. you can use a much shorter function / just handle your client.
2015-02-11 21:35:05	Elv1313	blueyed: maybe we could backport request::* in 3.5? I really miss it at work when I use 3.5.6
2015-02-11 21:36:07	Elv1313	ecormier: yes just use client.connect_signal("property::urgent",function() awful.util.spawn("aplay /path/to/sound.wav") end)
2015-02-11 21:36:23	ecormier	Elv1313: thanks, I'll look into that!
2015-02-11 21:36:23	blueyed	ecormier: you can call a process for the "urgent" signal, e.g. "play /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message-new-instant.ogg".
2015-02-11 21:36:24	Elv1313	or pick your favorite command to play sound
2015-02-11 21:36:50	ecormier	thanks guys :)
2015-02-11 21:37:39	blueyed	Elv1313: it might be not trivial to backport it - dunno.  If you miss it, give it a try.. :)
2015-02-11 21:38:10	blueyed	Elv1313: you would have my support, but then again it requires changes to the config (IIRC).
2015-02-11 21:38:47	Elv1313	it is quite trivial, the patches wont apply directly bacause of the globalconf.L -> L patch, but that's about it
2015-02-11 21:39:02	Elv1313	it was almost the first patch after 3.5 was branched
2015-02-11 21:39:29	Elv1313	I don't know if psychon will like that, but I will take a look
2015-02-11 21:44:05	ecormier	can someone ping my nick?
2015-02-11 21:44:46	Elv1313	ecormier: ping?
2015-02-11 21:44:57	ecormier	thanks
2015-02-11 21:45:22	Elv1313	who can also call the bell character with a sleep in a terminal to force a client to become urgent
2015-02-11 21:48:17	Elv1313	blueyed: so, can I merge #104?
2015-02-11 21:48:28	blueyed	Elv1313: yes, please :)

2015-02-11 21:53:47	blueyed	Elv1313: me too. Would be good if you could check if #105 works for you, especially as in does not segfault.. ^^
2015-02-11 21:55:56	ezekiel	so if request::activate is not in 3.5, and neither "focus" nor "focusable" work for properties in a rule, then the last option is override the focus function lik blueyed's first gist, right?

2015-02-11 21:57:13	blueyed	btw, focusable is a readonly property: True if the client can receive the input focus.
2015-02-11 22:00:31	ezekiel	btw, is the focus function originally part of awful.autofocus ?
2015-02-11 22:01:09	ezekiel	err, sorry, I guess not the focus function - since it looks like that's being created in the first rule
2015-02-11 22:01:25	ezekiel	oh, no that's just a property

2015-02-11 22:13:59	blueyed	awful.autofocus is some mechanism/module.
2015-02-11 22:14:14	blueyed	"focus" in awful.rules can be a property or function.
2015-02-11 22:15:11	blueyed	what program is it? can we take a look at it?

2015-02-11 22:18:22	ezekiel	certainly - the program is "Onboard". AFAIK, it's the default on-screen keyboard for Ubuntu
2015-02-11 22:20:13	ezekiel	so my simplified function is: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/962b0312/
2015-02-11 22:20:42	ezekiel	which seems like it should return nil for every "Onboard" class window
2015-02-11 22:21:00	ezekiel	yet... the window still gets focused
2015-02-11 22:21:39	ezekiel	oh shit, duh
2015-02-11 22:21:58	ezekiel	of course - awful.button({ }, 1, function (c) client.focus = c; c:raise() end),
2015-02-11 22:26:02	ezekiel	yay!
2015-02-11 22:26:32	ezekiel	re-defining that function for button 1 worked
2015-02-11 22:26:43	ecormier	another question if anyone is around: is there an easy way that I can trigger urgent/bell in a urxvt/tmux term for testing?
2015-02-11 22:26:52	ezekiel	obviously you all could not have known that I was testing focus _after_ a click on one of the on-screen keyboard keys
2015-02-11 22:27:26	ezekiel	ecormier: you could try echo -e "\a"
2015-02-11 22:27:42	ezekiel	which should echo the bell character, to be interpreted by the terminal
2015-02-11 22:28:24	ecormier	yep, that's good
2015-02-11 22:28:45	ezekiel	didn't work for mine, btw - I actually had to use: sleep 3; echo ^G
2015-02-11 22:29:02	ecormier	now I need to figure why this doesn't work: client.connect_signal("property::urgent",function() awful.util.spawn("play -v 0.5 /home/ecormier/Music/Soothing\ Alerts/WAV/Nudge.wav") end)
2015-02-11 22:29:05	ezekiel	ctrl+v, ctrl+g - to actually input the control character
2015-02-11 22:29:25	ecormier	worked here
2015-02-11 22:29:28	ezekiel	okay good
2015-02-11 22:29:45	ecormier	still not getting sound though
2015-02-11 22:30:19	ecormier	when a tag in the list gets highlighted, that is definitely urgent, right? or is it possible that I'm just getting bell?

2015-02-11 22:36:31	ezekiel	yo, ecormier - lua docs probably have some info about quoting that would help with that
2015-02-11 22:36:41	ezekiel	ecormier: maybe single quotes ?
2015-02-11 22:37:01	actionless	i noticed on github a comment with proposal for using some external lua module for some filesystem operation. so it raised for me a question -- did anyone considered somehow integrating luarocks into awesome wm. it will give a possibility to easily rely on different lua modules but also (i think not less important) to have sorta of user-contributed modules ecosystem
2015-02-11 22:38:08	ecormier	ezekiel: I'll play with that in a bit, but for now I must revel in the awesomeness :) I now have irssi running on a raspberry pi in a tmux session, which I'm connected to over ssh, and I'm getting audio notifications on a remote machine.... what is wicked!

2015-02-15 14:16:38	blueyed	Would it make sense to base the dbus request name (?) on $DISPLAY?

2015-02-15 17:39:45	normalra_	that sounds more of a Lua + OS question. Lua can execute other programs (which could play sounds), yes. There also might be libraries.

2015-02-15 18:32:50	blueyed	doginabag: you can use "play" and execute it: os.execute('play /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message-new-instant.ogg')
2015-02-15 18:33:14	blueyed	..you might want to do that asynchronously though (in the background).
2015-02-15 18:33:55	konni	right. because awesome does not thread and will hang while that sound plays...
2015-02-15 18:34:01	blueyed	Is there anything I have to take into account when trying to communicate via awesome-client/D-Bus with a second awesome instance running in Xephyr?
2015-02-15 18:34:35	konni	i have no idea. dbus is a black box for me... ;) 
2015-02-15 18:35:08	blueyed	doginabag: this will work as a hack: os.execute("sh -c 'play /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message-new-instant.ogg' &")

2015-02-15 21:55:05	Ram-Z	blueyed: moving the mouse out of the way is not so nice though, I don't think I can hide the cursor with awesome as unclutter seems to use a hack to do it (draw a window underneath the cursor with an attribute to no cursor icon or something)
2015-02-15 21:55:18	Ram-Z	thanks for the pointer though
2015-02-15 21:56:07	blueyed	Ram-Z: I was thinking about moving it away and when it gets moved start from where it was the last time.
2015-02-15 21:56:39	blueyed	There must be less hacky solution though, it's quite common for the cursor to disappear after some time/seconds automatically.
2015-02-15 21:57:00	Ram-Z	I think I'll use the -grab option of unclutter, which would remove the focus stealing behaviour on resizes, but doesn't focus the new window under the cursor when it's unhidden
2015-02-15 21:58:15	Ram-Z	hm... yeah... not a bad idea to replace it where it used to be
2015-02-15 21:59:14	Ram-Z	blueyed: I think most solution are window/client specific not server wide though
2015-02-15 21:59:46	Ram-Z	unclutter is the only application I found that hides the cursor wherever it is
2015-02-15 22:00:39	blueyed	I see.
2015-02-15 22:02:54	Ram-Z	argh... -grab breaks i3lock :(
2015-02-15 22:03:53	Ram-Z	here's the help on unclutter, might explain a bit better how it does things, if you're interested: http://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/unclutter-8.README

2015-02-15 23:02:06	blueyed	Ram-Z: trying out unclutter now, too.. how do you use it currently?
2015-02-15 23:02:22	Ram-Z	unclutter -idle 1
2015-02-15 23:03:25	blueyed	And what are your focus issues with it?  Are you using awesome from Git?
2015-02-15 23:07:20	Ram-Z	yes and it might actually be related to useless tiles though
2015-02-15 23:08:12	Ram-Z	it might be because the cursor sometimes is on top of the root window and not on any client
2015-02-15 23:08:39	Ram-Z	I had the focus issues with `unclutter -idle 1 -root` though
2015-02-15 23:09:46	Ram-Z	without -root the cursor is only shown for a sec when the window under the hidden cursor changes
2015-02-15 23:17:01	Ram-Z	blueyed: I can reproduce the problem on standard tila layout as well

2015-02-16 04:21:18	spyroboy	easily possible or just a binary attribute?

2015-02-16 15:26:13	spyroboy	I remember awesome 2.x
2015-02-16 15:26:15	Elv1313	it actually worked quite well
2015-02-16 15:26:30	spyroboy	2.x?
2015-02-16 15:27:26	spyroboy	I think 2.3 was when I got on board back in high school. it was really good and stable.

2015-02-16 15:30:24	spyroboy	looking at this rc
2015-02-16 15:30:33	spyroboy	there are definitely some things that 2.x made easy
2015-02-16 15:30:45	spyroboy	tag "      Multimedia" {layout = "max" }
2015-02-16 15:31:04	spyroboy	I had to go read the awesome API to figure out how to set custom layouts for each tag individually
2015-02-16 15:31:17	spyroboy	which is fine for me because I don't mind doing that.

2015-02-16 15:35:24	spyroboy	is because
2015-02-16 15:35:32	spyroboy	I use custom layouts for custom tags on different displays

2015-02-16 16:16:01	spyroboy	I have a bit of an issue with radical menu
2015-02-16 16:16:14	spyroboy	with the regular awful menu I had two sets of bindings

2015-02-16 16:16:27	spyroboy	where if I right clicked on the root window, it would spawn a window
2015-02-16 16:16:33	spyroboy	I configured radical menu to do this
2015-02-16 16:16:34	spyroboy	easy
2015-02-16 16:16:47	spyroboy	I had another binding for a widget on my wibox to spawn a menu that way
2015-02-16 16:17:01	spyroboy	but instead of spawning where the click occurred, I want it to spawn at the top left

2015-02-16 16:19:31	spyroboy	ok I think this is where I had my issue
2015-02-16 16:19:36	spyroboy	but I think I'm willing to compromise
2015-02-16 16:19:40	spyroboy	since this works better
2015-02-16 16:19:58	spyroboy	I also wanted it so that when I clicked on the root window, the menu would spawn where my mouse was
2015-02-16 16:20:07	spyroboy	so I tried setting x/y
2015-02-16 16:20:13	spyroboy	but then when I went to use the widget spawned menu
2015-02-16 16:20:16	spyroboy	it would bug out
2015-02-16 16:20:18	Elv1313	it does that automagically
2015-02-16 16:20:21	spyroboy	hm
2015-02-16 16:20:24	spyroboy	it's not doing it now
2015-02-16 16:20:36	spyroboy	if I right click on root window, it appears where the widget is
2015-02-16 16:20:47	Elv1313	if you set nothing it will open where the mouse is. If "parent_geometry" is set, then it will appear relative to that
2015-02-16 16:21:09	Elv1313	you can always unset "parent_geometry"
2015-02-16 16:21:21	spyroboy	can I only temporarily unset parent_geometry?
2015-02-16 16:21:36	Elv1313	I guess
2015-02-16 16:21:59	spyroboy	well I'll experiment later but I think I'm fine with what I have now
2015-02-16 16:22:09	spyroboy	since I kinda like how it's always in the same place
2015-02-16 16:23:02	spyroboy	hm

2015-02-16 17:36:53	normalra	So, I've found out that the reason why my images are blurred.
2015-02-16 17:37:49	normalra	It appears that an image is blurred when I attempt to inject an align layout inside another align layout :/.
2015-02-16 17:38:28	normalra	For instance, appending an imagebox within a vertical or horizontal layout directly onto the wibox panel doesn't result in a blurry image.
2015-02-16 17:40:12	normalra	And when you have that kind of arrangement, there's nowhere you can go! I want to be able to vertically position an unstretched image :c
2015-02-16 17:41:55	normalra	And I have no idea why the layout inside a layout would have this issue; there's plenty of space everywhere (actually there are no other widgets).
2015-02-16 17:42:42	normalra	Hmm.
2015-02-16 17:42:47	normalra	Maybe I'm wrong.
2015-02-16 17:42:56	normalra	It seems that the horizontal align is the culprit.

2015-03-14 14:46:16	spyroboy	I've recently found that when windows open they tend to be placed at 0,0 but unaccounting for the border
2015-03-14 14:46:26	spyroboy	so awesome places it on a different display

2015-03-14 16:11:35	Elv13	there is a lot of magic going on, some modules define their own shortcuts
2015-03-14 16:14:52	landscape69	Elv13: i need to set up the shortcuts why not let shortcuts.lua control all shortcuts=
2015-03-14 16:15:36	Elv13	in part because other people use some of my modules and they enjoy the fact that they profide their own shortcuts.lua
2015-03-14 16:16:07	Elv13	Then some modules, like collision and repetitive, just create way too many shortcuts (100+)
2015-03-14 16:16:37	landscape69	ah so its located in collision?
2015-03-14 16:16:54	Elv13	tyrannical
2015-03-14 16:17:05	landscape69	i see only #<numbers> so no clue what to press to get this
2015-03-14 16:17:40	Elv13	I use a G510 keyboard, it has 18 extra keys on the left
2015-03-14 16:17:53	landscape69	ah ok
2015-03-14 16:18:09	Elv13	you can use "xev" to get the number associated with extra keys
2015-03-14 16:18:29	Elv13	(like the media keys on some keyboards, to application shortcuts keys on others)
2015-03-14 16:18:49	landscape69	ok thanks

2015-03-14 16:34:21	khorne	Can someone tell me anything about awesome's suspend behavior? Or specifically the resume behavior after suspend? Because it doesn't properly resume, X glitches out and I have to reboot, the same machine with Cinnamon suspends and resumes just fine
2015-03-14 16:35:04	uso	another maybe related problem: when a program opens a popup window is there a way to force it to open that popup on the same screen?
2015-03-14 16:40:12	psychon	khorne: awesome doesnt notice suspend or does anything special
2015-03-14 16:40:18	psychon	khorne: perhaps your X server is having a bug?
2015-03-14 16:40:35	psychon	uso: clients shouldnt jump to other screen when they are being fullscreened
2015-03-14 16:40:48	psychon	uso: and popups should automatically be on the same screen as their parent

2015-03-14 18:23:04	psychon	uso: could you open such a popup and run xprop WM_TRANSIENT_FOR in a terminal, then click on the popup?
2015-03-14 18:23:24	psychon	uso: perhaps tvbrowser isnt marking the popup with "my parent is that window ->"
2015-03-14 18:23:27	psychon	for dosbox: dunno
2015-03-14 18:28:52	uso	psychon: not sure how the output of that "my parent is ..." has to look, I neither see it on the tvbrowser popup on the wrong screen nor on popups which are displayed on the correct screen
2015-03-14 18:30:27	uso	but tvbrowser is a java app which behaves weired anyway, but a least I can move it around manually after start
2015-03-14 18:30:49	uso	dosbox concerns me more as I cannot fix that behaviour manually
2015-03-14 18:34:32	uso	just tried another java program, josm
2015-03-14 18:35:05	uso	in the opposite to tvbrowser it starts on the correct screen but I only get a grey window :/
2015-03-14 18:35:20	uso	and I already have set wmname to LG3D
2015-03-14 18:38:28	uso	ha, I have to run wnmane L3GD on the same terminal just before I start josm and then it also opens it's window on the wrong screen ;)

2015-03-14 18:58:08	uso	I have started josm from a terminal on my right screen, the josm main window opens up on my left screen, I move it to my right screen with mod4+o, then I open the map selection window from josm which again pops up on my left screen although the josm main window is on my right screen
2015-03-14 18:59:00	uso	but then after I have closed josm and have started it again all windows appear on my right screen ...
2015-03-14 19:00:23	uso	btw why does a window which I have moved to another screen loses the focus?
2015-03-14 19:01:49	uso	quite annoying when I want to move a window from my left screen to the right screen as I have to re-focus it on the center screen after the first move before I can move it from the center screen to the right screen

2015-03-15 14:55:11	spyroboy	but in only some I float the window
2015-03-15 14:55:19	spyroboy	the window is floated in all tags
2015-03-15 14:55:31	spyroboy	ignore my previous reference to workspace. I meant tag.
2015-03-15 14:56:07	spyroboy	in any case, it seems like window status like floating or maximized is set on the client itself rather than in the tag
2015-03-15 14:56:21	spyroboy	is that intentional?

2015-04-01 00:28:17	crazedpsyc	I just solved a similar problem about 2 minutes ago, but my setup is with Optimus, so I'm not sure the solution is the same
2015-04-01 00:29:17	leiking	crazedpsyc: Thanks for help.
2015-04-01 00:29:41	crazedpsyc	though... come to think of it, optimus is just for turning the nvidia card on. if your card is already on, maybe it's the same from there out?
2015-04-01 00:29:43	leiking	crazedpsyc: what is your enviroment ?
2015-04-01 00:30:19	leiking	I am  work on a PC.
2015-04-01 00:30:22	crazedpsyc	archlinux on an alienware laptop, so an nvidia card and the intel chip, with optimus for switching the nvidia card on and off
2015-04-01 00:30:53	crazedpsyc	I don't have an xorg.conf, I used intel-virtual-display
2015-04-01 00:31:07	crazedpsyc	then I just configured my external with xrandr

2015-04-01 00:33:44	crazedpsyc	er, offloads drawing?
2015-04-01 00:34:02	crazedpsyc	I'm still hazy on this, I'm just amazed it finally works for me

2015-04-03 00:23:41	spyroboy	because from my research it seems like it's a per-application configuration
2015-04-03 00:24:25	daurnimator	spyroboy: under awesome, everything is small. under e.g. gnome, you change the scaling factor and it fixes everything that doesn't use it's own rendering engine (i.e. chrome)

2015-04-04 19:30:23	Alittlemurkling	Hello #awesome. I'm trying to get ncmpcpp to float at the bottom of my screen, setting the floating property seems to make it ignore all others. 
2015-04-04 19:31:44	Alittlemurkling	I launch ncmpcpp with "urxvt -name 'player_overlay' -T 'player_overlay' -e 'ncmpcpp'"
2015-04-04 19:33:18	Alittlemurkling	And the rule is: "{ rule = { instance = "player_overlay", class = "URxvt" }, properties = { floating = true, y = 680, } }
2015-04-04 19:33:21	Alittlemurkling	"
2015-04-04 19:35:12	Alittlemurkling	Is this the wrong way to go about this?

2015-04-06 14:09:35	razieliyo	my awesome doesn't get my ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua, and this is a fresh install, is there anything I'm passing?
2015-04-06 14:11:10	Elv1313_	razieliyo: first make sure the paths are right, then try awesome -k, then check ~/.xsession_errors for errors, else try Xephyr
2015-04-06 14:11:30	razieliyo	config syntax is ok
2015-04-06 14:11:53	razieliyo	but it may be using /etc/.../rc.lua
2015-04-06 14:11:59	Elv1313_	Watch out, Awesome 3.4 and 3.5 configs are not directly compatible
2015-04-06 14:12:57	razieliyo	no version clashes, my issue is just that it's not getting my user rc.lua file working
2015-04-06 14:13:11	razieliyo	I'll try xephyr
2015-04-06 14:13:37	Elv1313_	you can use strace + Xephyr just to be sure what happen

2015-04-13 11:56:27	actionless	after more testing it seems even more weird -- i suspect what it reacts like that only on some specific unicode strings
2015-04-13 11:56:49	Elv1313_	more than possible
2015-04-13 11:56:57	actionless	i remember lua works weird witrh unicode strings -- can it be related?
2015-04-13 11:57:01	actionless	aha, i see
2015-04-13 11:57:49	Elv1313_	I remember Awesome 3.4 had such a bug, maybe it was never fixed after all
2015-04-13 12:07:59	actionless	hm, tested it more -- seems like it depends not on encoding but on somespecific combination on word length, it reproduces more often when it's a shor word in the beginning
2015-04-13 12:08:20	actionless	*of word length

2015-04-13 12:08:55	rektide	is there any visual indication of mark that i'm missing?
2015-04-13 12:09:56	rektide	i seem to have accidentally marked a number of windows- had no cognizance of the capability in awesome- and it was getting rather frustrating trying to figure out what the hell. it was blindly going through key bindings that finally got me a fix.
2015-04-13 12:17:05	actionless	i guess it should be in beautiful
2015-04-13 12:17:55	actionless	yup, `theme.border_marked]`

2015-04-13 12:23:43	rektide	anyone use spotify client? is there a way to move the client? normal mod4 + left-mouse doesn't move it.
2015-04-13 12:23:54	actionless	maximize twice
2015-04-13 12:23:58	actionless	chrome bug
2015-04-13 12:24:54	rektide	hmm now it at least works in a tiled layout, that's a step forward
2015-04-13 12:25:54	actionless	on a tiled layout you're moving it with mouse as well?
2015-04-13 12:26:03	rektide	i'll resize layout some in tiled layouts
2015-04-13 12:26:25	rektide	(mod4 + rmb)
2015-04-13 12:26:42	rektide	i still don't seem to have control when i'm in the "float" unconstrained layout
2015-04-13 12:27:29	actionless	and can you do that with keyboard in floating mode?
2015-04-13 12:27:55	rektide	oh there we go. it's a little finnicky- mod4 + rmb moved my selectino to the lower right, then if i release and left click- which is what spotify wants- I can readjust it's size
2015-04-13 12:28:08	rektide	no, that'd be wild
2015-04-13 12:28:47	rektide	ah, that's just resize. still no move, still anchored top left
2015-04-13 12:29:07	actionless	mb u have some specific rule for it somewhere in your config?
2015-04-13 12:29:26	rektide	stock debian install, for whatever that's worth
2015-04-13 12:29:45	rektide	i'm under the impression spotify does some nasty grabbing that interferes with awesome doing what it does
2015-04-13 12:30:03	rektide	but that's pretty wild guessing
2015-04-13 12:30:13	actionless	so how it's with keyboard? is it moving?

2015-04-15 00:55:06	dteske	after searching i can't get to open a specific app to a specific monitor.
2015-04-15 00:55:14	dteske	how to do that ?
2015-04-15 00:56:24	McLenin	Add a rule for it
2015-04-15 00:56:27	McLenin	something like
2015-04-15 00:56:34	McLenin	{ rule = { class = "Thunderbird" }, properties = {tag = tags[2][9]}},
2015-04-15 00:56:57	McLenin	Where the first number is the monitor number and the second on is the tag/workspace number
2015-04-15 00:57:29	McLenin	Of course use the right name for your app as well :)

2015-04-27 12:14:16	actionless	Elv1313_work, hi! so i got stucked trying to understand how 'forgotten' intended to handle tables
2015-04-27 12:14:53	Elv1313_work	actionless: The last few commits are quite buggy
2015-04-27 12:15:39	Elv1313_work	It works, but I tried to do too much majic and burn myself. Lua __equal metatable and some others are not flexible enough to make it totally work
2015-04-27 12:16:10	Elv1313_work	However, if you remove the code that try to create all the intermediate tables, then it start working again
2015-04-27 12:16:25	Elv1313_work	You can get and set values and it save the file
2015-04-27 12:30:04	actionless	but the problem was usually with access by index, in some cases it was treated like domain.subsomain.subdomain.table, sometimes domain.table.index.index and so on

2015-04-30 12:05:49	Elv1313	that's not the same file
2015-04-30 12:06:26	dtestke	yeah other than that i don't have any core.lua file

2015-05-02 14:16:44	AidanCollier	I've been having a few issues in my (first) awesome setup lately. First I've been finding that fonts aren't being chosen as they should, where 'UnifrakturCook' and similar fonts are being rendered in place of vastly different fonts on webpages and some applications. I have a screenshot of this case in firefox at:http://imgur.com/E8Ceqv6. Would you know if this is simply a case of how I need to install more fonts onto my 
2015-05-02 14:16:44	AidanCollier	system, or is there some configuration I need to do to fix this under Awesome? (This hadn't happened under any of the other desktops/window managers I've used in the past, including Openbox, so I'm not so sure what would be behind this!) My other issue is setting widget spacing in the wibox, where I'm seeing clearly crowded widgets. You can see this here:http://imgur.com/GR92E46, where my volume text widget (the '0M') and 
2015-05-02 14:16:45	AidanCollier	the text clock (the '11:58') look like a single string. What variables in particular do I need to change to add a 5px margin between each widget? I've been looking around, but I haven't been able to find a solution which won't kick me back to the fallback configuration.

2015-05-04 15:13:10	spyroboy	those icons
2015-05-04 15:13:18	spyroboy	look really similar to the ones I came up with
2015-05-04 15:13:20	spyroboy	in style
2015-05-04 15:13:43	spyroboy	maybe I should submit them
2015-05-04 15:15:30	Elv1313	go ahead, don't wait for too long, I don't want to change them twice
2015-05-04 15:15:34	Elv1313	any screenshot?
2015-05-04 15:16:04	spyroboy	they're actually not related to the ones in that pull request
2015-05-04 15:16:11	spyroboy	mine are for the layouts in the wibox
2015-05-04 15:16:28	spyroboy	but sure I can provide a screenshot
2015-05-04 15:16:33	Elv1313	we replaced those recently
2015-05-04 15:16:39	spyroboy	oh really?
2015-05-04 15:16:42	spyroboy	lemme check
2015-05-04 15:17:02	spyroboy	ah I see
2015-05-04 15:17:03	spyroboy	23 days ago
2015-05-04 15:17:06	Elv1313	yea, they skipped the review, jd_ pushed them directly
2015-05-04 15:17:17	spyroboy	yeah these ones looks good
2015-05-04 15:17:59	spyroboy	I'll post a screenshot anyway for the sake of it
2015-05-04 15:18:02	spyroboy	for your reference
2015-05-04 15:18:08	spyroboy	but these look good and consistent

2015-05-04 15:22:19	spyroboy	http://imgur.com/a/dad8a these are the layouts, Elv1313 
2015-05-04 15:22:28	spyroboy	for some reason the "thumbnails" are all fucked
2015-05-04 15:22:31	spyroboy	so just click on it
2015-05-04 15:23:37	spyroboy	http://imgur.com/4cR73b5 this is my menu icon
2015-05-04 15:24:01	spyroboy	and to give it context, this is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/Fepv10y.png
2015-05-04 15:25:01	Elv1313	http://i.imgur.com/r100vVQ.png
2015-05-04 15:25:38	spyroboy	I designed mine with something differnet in mind
2015-05-04 15:25:45	spyroboy	I didn't like how the icons were scaled
2015-05-04 15:26:02	spyroboy	they're really small because they're actually "unscaled" to my wibox height
2015-05-04 15:26:15	spyroboy	so essentially "pixel perfect"
2015-05-04 15:26:52	spyroboy	but I understand that's not very helpful depending on screen density
2015-05-04 15:27:16	spyroboy	not that I'm sure awesome does anything to accomodate for density
2015-05-04 15:27:51	spyroboy	yours look nice

2015-05-04 15:28:38	Elv1313	awesome use the dpi font settings to ajust height, icons are just scaled
2015-05-04 15:28:47	spyroboy	I wish I knew more about Qt
2015-05-04 15:29:30	Elv1313	I am sure you can make that happen ;)
2015-05-04 15:29:42	spyroboy	documentation is kinda sparse :(
2015-05-04 15:30:01	spyroboy	I tried learning it because I started to hack around in a game client called cockatrice.
2015-05-04 15:30:13	spyroboy	also another application called lighttasks
2015-05-04 15:30:37	spyroboy	I made some progress in my hacks.
2015-05-04 15:31:19	Elv1313	I am not sure I agree about the doc. Qt has the best first party doc of all Linux GUI toolkits
2015-05-04 15:32:02	spyroboy	that may be true
2015-05-04 15:32:34	spyroboy	but it doesn't mean it's easy to understand
2015-05-04 15:32:43	spyroboy	every toolkit has its own jargon and stuff

2015-05-04 15:33:03	spyroboy	like I spent a long time trying to figure out how to change the color of something
2015-05-04 15:33:16	spyroboy	I didn't realize you had to use CSS-esque styling
2015-05-04 15:33:27	spyroboy	or something like that
2015-05-04 15:34:28	Elv1313	well, there is a bunch of pages to rerad before starting to use Qt: Signals&Slots, Qt Model/View, Styling, QWidget vs. QML and the class list

2015-05-04 15:35:25	spyroboy	did they update this documentation recently?

2015-05-04 15:36:37	Elv1313	yes, they did update the CSS when they moved from qt-project.org to qt.io
2015-05-04 15:36:52	spyroboy	I might take a look again at this doc
2015-05-04 15:37:02	spyroboy	it might've been a while since I've last looked at it
2015-05-04 15:38:38	spyroboy	I should probably also get used to C++ syntax
2015-05-04 15:39:17	Elv1313	well, that's the hard part :)
2015-05-04 15:40:52	spyroboy	yeah .. I do C/Perl/Ruby/PHP/Go .. and none of these have official Qt doc

2015-05-09 14:52:01	damex	hello, i like to interest about issue i can't properly google. how do i make 'almost default' awesomewm configuration show notifications and do tag binds using current display instead of one that was first detected by xorg-x11. should i paste my config?
2015-05-09 14:52:50	damex	s/x11./x11\?/
2015-05-09 14:54:30	Fluor	your question fails to parse for me. what's this 'using current display instead of one the wat first detected by xorg-x11'-stuff

2015-05-09 15:00:14	damex	Fluor: okay. i am bad at describing stuff. i have two displays. notebook screen and external monitor/tv. xorg configured to have notebook screen first and external one is at the left. so main screen is notebook screen. if i run awesomewm and use display that is not the 'main screen' for xorg-x11 - all dbus notifications and other stuff still going to that notebook screen that is 'main screen'.

2015-05-09 15:02:59	damex	i can provide any info you need to understand that situation or try to describe more clearly
2015-05-09 15:03:29	Fluor	so, you want to move the position of your 'systray
2015-05-09 15:03:34	Fluor	so, you want to move the position of your 'systray' widget
2015-05-09 15:06:45	damex	Fluor: thx for pointing to the right direction. i will try to google a bit;
2015-05-09 15:09:35	Fluor	'if s == 1 then right_layout:add(wibox.widget.systray()) end'

2015-05-09 15:11:13	Fluor	no idea what happens when you add a systray to both screens. :)
2015-05-09 15:13:04	damex	Fluor: i'v removed condition and it have some weird behaviour. can it be shown on all displays?
2015-05-09 15:15:34	damex	Fluor: also systray on second screen and dbus notifications coming to the first one.

2015-05-09 15:30:59	Fluor	i think it works best if on one specific display. or that condition wouldn't be there in the stock config. on your setup, try == 2 to move it to the other display i think.
2015-05-09 15:31:40	damex	Fluor: i'v forced to second display. it is forced. that tray. but notifications coming to the first display.

2015-05-15 12:17:25	nagerst	yes i did.. it is still hard to find the proper answer.

2015-05-16 21:19:26	blueyed	spyroboy: I agree, these properties should be handled better across tags.
2015-05-16 21:19:48	blueyed	What should happen to a floating client if it's moved to a tiled tag?
2015-05-16 21:20:44	blueyed	Should there be some default, or maybe rather an override? I.e. the initial settings are default, but could then be overridden per tag (if you change them there).
2015-05-16 21:21:18	blueyed	But that might be still awkward when trying to apply it to three tags (manually).
2015-05-16 21:22:04	blueyed	I think it makes sense to create an issue for that, and then outline your use case, i.e. how do you start the video? How do you attach it to three tags? etc.
2015-05-16 21:23:29	blueyed	tock: I've spent some time with autorandr (the Python fork) and it's really useful.
2015-05-16 21:24:10	blueyed	IbrahimA|away: I've mapped arandr. It's really nice to setup configs for autorandr.
2015-05-16 21:32:11	tock	blueyed: That was the point : no need to hack into X libs.
2015-05-16 21:41:56	blueyed	Is there nice script/prog to control the volume?  I am currently using "pactl set-sink-mute 0 false ; pactl set-sink-volume 0 +/-5%"", but would like to have some feedback (OSD). pactl does not seem to have an easy method to get the current value?!

2015-05-19 15:35:02	lie	Elv1313, mb to add them as global keybindings when menu opens and remove from global hotkeys when menu is closed? or global hotkeys can't be removed once they were added?
2015-05-19 15:35:42	Elv1313	they can hardly be removed, and this is an expensive (slow) method call
2015-05-19 15:36:45	Elv1313	With the default config, they cannot be removed because awful.utils.table.join mess (and destroy) the original data structure and the information is lost
2015-05-19 15:38:15	damex	Elv1313: so there is a way just to remove keyboard input (all input) from situations when you open menu by right click on free space or just on top bar?

2015-05-20 13:12:28	damex	haha dafuq. hello ;p i'v just installed chromium to replace my firefox and when it takes all space - chromium menu goes to the closest screen that is at the right ;/
2015-05-20 13:12:49	damex	is there workaround for such thing? should i do a screenshot to show it?
2015-05-20 13:13:10	spyroboy	uhm
2015-05-20 13:13:17	Elv1313	Bark at chrome developpers?
2015-05-20 13:13:37	spyroboy	definitely sounds like chrome is broken
2015-05-20 13:13:49	spyroboy	damex, do me a favour
2015-05-20 13:13:59	Elv1313	known bug, reported many time, its on their side
2015-05-20 13:14:12	spyroboy	float the window, resize the window
2015-05-20 13:14:16	spyroboy	move it around a few pixels
2015-05-20 13:14:18	Elv1313	(reported to us, nobody is someone ever reported it to them)
2015-05-20 13:14:20	spyroboy	then try the menus again
2015-05-20 13:14:24	damex	spyroboy: it works when you resize it 
2015-05-20 13:14:46	spyroboy	honestly, this is an issue that awesome has with intellij as well
2015-05-20 13:15:06	Elv1313	and libreoffice
2015-05-20 13:15:08	spyroboy	regardless of whether the software is at fault, there's definitely something awesome can do to mitigate the issue
2015-05-20 13:15:31	spyroboy	psychon and I were talking about it a long time ago. I wanted to try to patch it but I never had time to dig into it more.
2015-05-20 13:15:38	Elv1313	spyroboy: you can always get a nice x11trace and fix it
2015-05-20 13:15:43	damex	spyroboy: Win+M => it takes all space from the screen and menu goes to the closest screen. Win+M again and it return to the small sized window but menu works.
2015-05-20 13:16:25	spyroboy	Elv1313, I know. just I personally don't know how and I don't have much time these days to figure out how.
2015-05-20 13:16:35	spyroboy	not blaming anyone.
2015-05-20 13:16:43	spyroboy	damex, that sounds maybe like a slightly different issue
2015-05-20 13:16:57	spyroboy	maybe it's the same
2015-05-20 13:17:14	Elv1313	... nobody has time these day (even I havn't commited to my config in months)
2015-05-20 13:17:20	spyroboy	yeah
2015-05-20 13:17:36	spyroboy	I should dig up the conversation and fill out an issue so we don't forget about it.
2015-05-20 13:18:22	damex	spyroboy: menu here goes to the second screen when space between border of chromium and screen border is 1/6 or less.
2015-05-20 13:18:24	damex	so thats it

2015-05-21 11:38:25	Joseki	Hello
2015-05-21 11:39:35	Joseki	I am searching a way to remove a widget from my toolbar on specific event
2015-05-21 11:41:57	Joseki	The widget is added in a wibox.layout by :add() and would like to remove it
2015-05-21 11:49:53	Joseki	If I can change the content of the toolbar it could fit my need
2015-05-21 11:49:58	Joseki	any idea ?
2015-05-21 11:51:14	spyroboy	I think there might be a method for hiding and showing
2015-05-21 11:51:22	spyroboy	are you attempting to toggle?
2015-05-21 11:51:31	Joseki	Yes !
2015-05-21 11:51:49	spyroboy	Joseki, what's the widget you're working with?
2015-05-21 11:51:52	spyroboy	text?
2015-05-21 11:51:53	Joseki	spyroboy it is an auto-hiding feature
2015-05-21 11:52:19	Joseki	Yes mostly text but I would be able to disable any of them
2015-05-21 11:53:24	spyroboy	sec let me see if I can find out for you
2015-05-21 11:53:45	Elv1313	Joseki: You can remove the widget from the table directly, but an easier trick is to override the "fit(self,w,h)" method to return 0,0 when the widget should be hidden
2015-05-21 11:54:07	Joseki	For example if the widget is not revellant (batwidget on a desktop) I made a flag to not add it
2015-05-21 11:54:44	Joseki	But I would like to be able to dynamicly add/remove 
2015-05-21 11:55:04	Joseki	Elv1313, thank you I'll test it
2015-05-21 11:55:37	spyroboy	yeah I guess there isn't a built-in hide/show
2015-05-21 11:55:40	spyroboy	I thought there was
2015-05-21 11:56:52	Elv1313	spyroboy: The fit trick is less or more considerred the official way of doing it. It should however be quite trivial to implement some code to skip hidden widgets when looping the contianers
2015-05-21 11:56:55	Joseki	No I didn't find that so I can stick with my actual solution "you stay with what you got on first launch"
2015-05-21 11:58:39	Joseki	Elv1313, spyroboy, yes but delete it without being able to re add is not an ideal solution
2015-05-21 11:59:03	Elv1313	Joseki: that's what the fit trick is for. It does exactly what you want
2015-05-21 11:59:35	Joseki	I need to find an example to test it
2015-05-21 12:00:30	spyroboy	the reason why the fit trick works is because it just tells it to render nothing
2015-05-21 12:00:39	spyroboy	the widget still exists and in the same place
2015-05-21 12:00:43	Elv1313	local tb = wibox.widget.textbox(); local oldfir = tb.fit; tb.fit = function(self,w,h) if hidden then return 0,0 else return oldfit(self,w,h) end
2015-05-21 12:00:47	spyroboy	it just renders a widget of size 0x0
2015-05-21 12:01:10	Joseki	Yes it seem's can do the trick
2015-05-21 12:01:12	spyroboy	I agree with this solution
2015-05-21 12:01:30	spyroboy	Elv1313, that being said, do you think it'd be appropriate to add this sort of functionality to the API?
2015-05-21 12:02:59	Elv1313	I guess it would yes, but we have little time these days, patches welcome
2015-05-21 12:03:11	Joseki	Elv1313, thank I'll test it asap
2015-05-21 12:04:14	Elv1313	spyroboy: a new property need to be added and /usr/share/awesome/lib/wibox/layout/align.lua "fit" method updated
2015-05-21 12:04:50	Elv1313	flex.lua and fixed.lua also need the same update
2015-05-21 12:07:13	spyroboy	I'll see if I can devote some time to that
2015-05-21 12:08:13	Elv1313	thanks, it isn't that much work and some users would appreciate not having to use the hack. Awesome 3.4 had that feature
2015-05-21 12:09:01	spyroboy	I'm not really the best lua programmer out there so trying to learn by doing small things :P
2015-05-21 12:09:56	Elv1313	that's how to become the best lua programmer :P
2015-05-21 12:10:03	spyroboy	yep

2015-05-24 18:19:48	synbyte	I'm launching a youtube video in mpv when clicking on a youtube link in luakit, but can't seem to open mpv as fullscreen on my netbook screen, only my external screen. When I double click mpv to disable fullscreen, the mpv windon is on the correct screen. Any idea why it doesn't fullscreen on that screen initially?

2015-05-24 18:32:29	synbyte	I could just pull the finger out and drag the window over to the netbook screen every time, but it just wouldn't be... ideal.
2015-05-24 18:33:46	tock	shortcut : awful.key({ modkey,  }, "o",  awful.client.movetoscreen     ),
2015-05-24 18:34:06	tock	(just in case)
2015-05-24 18:36:45	synbyte	Good sugestion. I guess I could work around it but moving the mouse to the netbook screen before spawning mpv, then moving the mouse back to the center of the external monitor.
2015-05-24 18:36:52	synbyte	Seems pretty dirty though.

2015-05-24 19:40:38	litb	hello all
2015-05-24 19:40:46	litb	how can i split a tag?
2015-05-24 19:40:58	litb	i looked into man awesome, but couldn't find a key
2015-05-24 19:41:34	tock	Sorry, litb, but I don't see what you mean.
2015-05-24 19:41:47	litb	sorry this is my first try with awesome
2015-05-24 19:42:24	litb	just wanna show the currently shown windows vertically split 50/50
2015-05-24 19:42:32	litb	currently they are overlappiing
2015-05-24 19:45:01	tock	All right. So your default tag setup is floating. Change it with MODKEY (SUPER/Win)+space
2015-05-24 19:46:01	litb	hm chromium is still in the background. what's different for it is that there are two arrows in its entry in the taskbar
2015-05-24 19:46:10	litb	not sure what they mean. perhaps "unsplittable" ?
2015-05-24 19:46:32	litb	tock, the icon in the upper-right changed to a whirl now
2015-05-24 19:47:05	tock	MODKEY+m on your chromium window. MODKEY+Space, till you get what you want.
2015-05-24 19:47:09	litb	tock, previously i set it to be: one large left area and on the right, 3 small windows
2015-05-24 19:47:19	litb	but i wanted to see how to split it manually, without those fixed layouts
2015-05-24 19:47:38	litb	ah hm, can i not split it up further than what the layout gives?
2015-05-24 19:47:47	tock	This layout is what you want to get 2 windows splitted equally.
2015-05-24 19:48:38	litb	ah it was maximized
2015-05-24 19:48:59	litb	i know it from other tiling WMs where you can move a window down and exchange them with another window that was below it
2015-05-24 19:49:13	tock	You can then ajust the width with modkey+ right mouse button, or modkey+l/h
2015-05-24 19:50:26	litb	i see

2015-05-25 15:07:19	AidanCollier	The Line would look like "theme.icon_theme = 'Numix-Circle' " If I had a folder named 'Numix-Circle' in /usr/share/icons?

2015-05-25 15:11:04	AidanCollier	Elv1313: The Numix-Circle Icon theme never appears when I restart.
2015-05-25 15:11:16	AidanCollier	Elv1313: However, The 'moka' theme does.
2015-05-25 15:11:53	AidanCollier	Elv1313: Does the wibox need a particular format of icons, such as 48x48?
2015-05-25 15:12:40	Elv1313	[hack] maybe you could make a symlink from Numix-Circle to moka2?
2015-05-25 15:13:35	Elv1313	if that still doesn't work, then blame that widget code (which I hate and is totally inefficient)
2015-05-25 15:15:31	AidanCollier	Elv1313: I'll see about this later. Thanks!

2015-05-30 14:23:21	Guest7043	evening. I'm having issues with some basic keymapping. I've managed to set XF86AudioRaiseVolume to trigger ponymix and the volume is increased as expected. What I don't understand is that the trigger only works when a window is active? If I go to an empty workspace without any open windows the keybinding does nothing?
2015-05-30 14:25:45	Guest7043	for the trigger I'm using awful.key({ }), "XF86AudioRaiseVolume", function () awful.util.spawn("ponymix -c 0 increase 10") end),

2015-05-30 14:59:15	Nuolatinis	Hey guys, I'm trying to write a simple widget and need to draw a textbox in arbitrary screen location (something like notification) but with ability to grab a keyboard and process keyboard events. Basically, I wanna type on my widget and see what I'm typing, something similar to a prompt on a notification widget. 
2015-05-30 14:59:45	Nuolatinis	So, what would be the best way to do it? I'm looking to using keygrabber and redrawing notification widget from naughty. Is it cool?

2015-05-30 15:02:34	Nuolatinis	is there a better way to achieve similar functionality?
2015-05-30 15:02:59	konni	again, not sure. you could probably hijack the run-prompt
2015-05-30 15:03:10	konni	and just execute something else with the argument
2015-05-30 15:04:08	Nuolatinis	yeah, but then is there a way to add a prompt textbox to a notification widget?

2015-05-31 16:02:27	sochan	okay, now I see
2015-05-31 16:02:49	sochan	so there is indeed ssh-agent and gpg-agent configured in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/
2015-05-31 16:03:01	sochan	but they start only if some requirements are fulfilled
2015-05-31 16:03:16	sochan	use-agent has to be set in .gnugpg/gpg.conf
2015-05-31 16:03:39	sochan	and fo ssh-agent there has to be use-ssh-agent in /etc/X11/Xsession.options
2015-05-31 16:03:45	sochan	so that's a lesson learned
2015-05-31 16:04:35	sochan	thanks for pointing me int he right direction Fluor

2015-06-01 19:05:55	yonoid	I'm also, trying to see here in the default config, `tags` is a dictionary that doesn't really get passed to anything than a mouse command.  Is it just a convention that awesome will use the `tags` variable?
2015-06-01 19:07:00	Elv1313	the variable is unused
2015-06-01 19:07:19	Elv1313	you can use it as a "global" in rc.lua if you wish to update tags later

2015-06-01 20:34:50	Korendir	Well, just curious about a few things pertaining to awesome..  I think I have it working .. Gentoo in a Virtualbox .. I downloaded some themes 
2015-06-01 20:35:21	yonoid	Thanks blueyed.  I'm just restarting manually for now.  After I redirected stderr from .xinitrc I saw I have an issue with D-Bus to sort out later
2015-06-01 20:35:29	Korendir	Unfortunately, there are several files which it attempts to access because of the required entries in the rc.lua file that I don't have on my system..

2015-06-01 20:57:20	blueyed	Korendir: gears should be in awesome. Which version are you using?
2015-06-01 20:58:03	blueyed	gears appears to be added in 3.5. Are you using 3.4? (which would be bad for you)
2015-06-01 20:58:49	blueyed	It's a pity that Debian/Ubuntu still has 3.4.. :/
2015-06-01 20:59:04	blueyed	3.5.5 would be in Debian experimental.
2015-06-01 20:59:09	Korendir	Hehe.. yes.. 3.4.15 .. that's the one .. I guess I'll download the recent one.. Gentoo only wants stable versions so heh..

2015-06-05 14:52:43	mb_	How do I do vertical text in awesome 3.5?
2015-06-05 14:52:53	mb_	like this (this is 3.4) http://bues.ch/images/myawesome.png
2015-06-05 14:53:00	mb_	see left side

2015-06-05 14:53:30	mb_	In 3.4 I just tuned the wiboxes around and it automagically turned the text, too
2015-06-05 14:54:12	mb_	Ah ok. I tried with vertical layout. That seems wrong then
2015-06-05 15:03:24	mb_	Cool that works. Thanks a lot ;)
2015-06-05 15:09:10	Osleg	Is there any way to make interactive notifications?
2015-06-05 15:16:21	Elv1313	Osleg: with some work, it is not there by default

2015-06-07 02:12:44	Alissa	You can't run Awesome without a DM, can you? O.o
2015-06-07 02:17:50	IntelliJuser	If you mean one of these by DM: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-top-linux-desktop-environments-available/, I'm running it on the X server directly
2015-06-07 02:18:48	Alissa	You have the X server, then you have the display manager, then you have the window manager which can contain a desktop environment.
2015-06-07 02:19:02	Alissa	The display manager can be like LightDM, LXDM, or something else.

2015-06-07 02:23:13	IntelliJuser	Is desktop environment the same as desktop manager here?
2015-06-07 02:23:22	Alissa	Nope.
2015-06-07 02:25:59	IntelliJuser	I login in using GDM, I start awesome wm directly, and I don't start anything adidtionally. Could you please clarify what you mean by desktop manager (examples?
2015-06-07 02:27:02	Alissa	Then that is your display manager.
2015-06-07 02:27:30	Alissa	Gnome Display Manager
2015-06-07 02:28:09	Alissa	If you don't mind, please try to make a new service (without replacing the display-manager service) and replicate the issue and make sure it is Awesome's fault.
2015-06-07 02:31:43	IntelliJuser	new service = different window manager ?
2015-06-07 02:32:00	Alissa	Yeah. Sorry.
2015-06-07 02:32:42	IntelliJuser	gnome/unity work fine
2015-06-07 02:33:08	IntelliJuser	https://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java
2015-06-07 02:33:41	IntelliJuser	I have the menu off-by-one trouble too.
2015-06-07 02:35:29	IntelliJuser	I have multiple intellij windows; switching between works for say, about 10 times (or maybe time), then some windows get stuck. I restart awesome, then it starts working again
2015-06-07 02:38:41	tango_	Alissa: the DM doesn't interfere with the WM in any way, it's in a _separate_ X server
2015-06-07 02:39:01	IntelliJuser	I also have the delay_raise fix as I mentioned before set at 50ms.
2015-06-07 02:39:55	tango_	btw I thought awesome 3.5 was now reparenting?
2015-06-07 02:40:26	IntelliJuser	tango_: Thanks for clarifying; I was confused for a bit...
2015-06-07 02:40:58	IntelliJuser	The problem happens after a while
2015-06-07 02:41:09	IntelliJuser	everything works when I initially launch intellij
2015-06-07 02:42:06	IntelliJuser	I have the window set at manximized using tyrannical and awful.rules; floating mode always caused it not to raise
2015-06-07 02:43:53	IntelliJuser	Where would be a good place to post about this problem?

2015-06-14 00:13:20	abbe	I'm trying awesome, and wondering if anything suits my setup. I've dual head setup which has two X11 screens, :0.0, and :0.1. I started Awesome WM 3.5.6 with default configuration, and I only see Awesome stuff on :0.0
2015-06-14 00:13:23	abbe	and not :0.1
2015-06-14 00:14:00	abbe	so I'm wondering if I need to start another awesome instance for :0.1, or same instance will work.
2015-06-14 00:14:27	abbe	Before Awesome, I was running Fluxbox which was aware of both screens.

2015-06-14 16:15:08	Guest1634	I missed something for sure. But cannot find any details in the api

2015-06-14 16:39:25	choosy	Hi there!
2015-06-14 16:39:47	choosy	I am using awesome 3.5.6 on a recent fedora
2015-06-14 16:40:10	choosy	I have been using awesome for a few years....but now on this new system I have a problem
2015-06-14 16:40:22	choosy	I am not sure if anyone can help...
2015-06-14 16:41:14	petoju	choosy: maybe; but we cannot know, if you don't ask
2015-06-14 16:41:14	choosy	when I change to tag,...the last tag is still selected...and the current tag is only underlined...and the bar where the windows are shown is not updated
2015-06-14 16:41:21	choosy	:)
2015-06-14 16:41:40	choosy	this behaviour magically corrects if I set local titlebars_enabled = true
2015-06-14 16:42:01	choosy	it seems that some action on a client in that tag...restores the view of the tag...with the taskbar and all that
2015-06-14 16:42:30	choosy	I think it is called task bar (the bar where tags are, and where you see the client symbols and titles)
2015-06-14 16:43:15	choosy	the same "fixing" behaviour happens if I maximize a client on the tag I just moved
2015-06-14 16:44:30	choosy	when I mean the last tag is still selected, I mean that old tag is highlighted in the bar. But I do see the client in the new tag
2015-06-14 16:45:07	choosy	it seems like that taskbar is desyncronized...remains behind
2015-06-14 16:47:58	choosy	it seems I get this behaviour with the default rc.lua...the one that came from Fedora
2015-06-14 16:48:13	Guest1634	so does someone know how to hide an imagebox in awesome 3.5 ?

2015-06-19 20:41:33	Unode	is there any builtin way of logging (debugging messages) to stdout (I'm redirecting to a logfile). I've looked through the API reference and didn't find anything. Simple print() or io.write doesn't work. Google isn't helping either.
2015-06-19 20:42:12	Unode	I see warnings and exceptions on the logfile though (if I make mistakes).
2015-06-19 20:58:57	blueyed	Unode: the print gets buffered probably.  IIRC I've fixed this in Git master a while ago.

2015-06-19 21:11:12	blueyed	Unode: let me know how it works for you.
2015-06-19 21:17:24	Unode	blueyed: hum, I don't recompile awesome myself. Was expecting the fix to be in lua files :)
2015-06-19 21:17:29	Unode	sorry about that.
2015-06-19 21:18:09	 *	blueyed is using "exec >  >(tee -a $LOG); exec 2> >(tee -a $LOG >&2)" before starting awesome, which appears to not require the setbuf().
2015-06-19 21:18:20	blueyed	Unode: how do you redirect it to a log?
2015-06-19 21:18:46	Unode	blueyed: startx &> log basically
2015-06-19 21:19:39	blueyed	Then it should show up there..  but maybe delayed (because of the buffering)
2015-06-19 21:21:39	Unode	I'll try to print more bytes to see if I can trigger a flush

2015-06-19 21:33:05	Unode	blueyed: yup it does print. But the buffer takes quite some time to get full
2015-06-19 21:34:57	blueyed	That was my experience before also - I wonder why it now works better. Maybe the usage of "tee" or something else makes it unbuffered for me.
2015-06-19 21:35:18	blueyed	Anyway, the patch from the PR would probably help - in case you want to try out master.. :)

2015-06-20 12:36:23	psychon	and this interacts badly with sticky clients (once they ever had focus, they will always "win" on tag switch since they are more recently focused than all clients on the current tag)
2015-06-20 12:39:53	wldmr	Sounds annoying.
2015-06-20 12:40:57	wldmr	But it's cool to hear that the solution for me (other than this workaround) is basically "wait for the update".
2015-06-20 12:41:22	wldmr	Again, thanks. Very much appreciated.

2015-06-21 18:47:28	petoju	aajjbb: (just an idea, not my case) - what about putting script with "xscreensaver-command -lock" to /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ ?

2015-06-21 18:51:19	aajjbb	I'm still a beginner, scripts in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ after the end of a sleep ?
2015-06-21 18:52:01	petoju	aajjbb: they should be executed before and after hibernation/sleep
2015-06-21 18:52:08	petoju	aajjbb: they get 2 parameters
2015-06-21 18:52:40	petoju	aajjbb: you should test it, but I think first ($1) is pre/post and second is action like hibernation or sleep

2015-06-22 10:08:21	uovobw	side the window B itself or if i press mod+tab. what am i doing wrong? with the "old" awesome the focus would _always_ follow mouse even switching workspaces. thanks in advance

2015-06-30 12:12:54	Elv1313	von: you can use it like module.exec.command("ls") : connect_signal("request::completed", function(result) print(result) end)
2015-06-30 12:13:08	Unode	Is there any builtin function (similar to run_or_raise) that instead of checking by window attributes checks by process existence? Like pgrep or similar variants.
2015-06-30 12:13:32	Elv1313	Unode: you can always write one
2015-06-30 12:15:41	Unode	Elv1313: :)
2015-06-30 12:16:00	Unode	Elv1313: just wondering if something existed. Since I figure it'd be quite common.
2015-06-30 12:16:36	Elv1313	People use tags very differently, you would be surprised of how rich the "workflow ecosystem" around Awesome is
2015-06-30 12:20:05	alxgnon	I would like awesome to ignore modkey combinations that don't exist instead of passing the keys through to the client. For example, if I press `modkey + Q` and that shortcut does not exist, I do not want the letter q to be typed into the client.
2015-06-30 12:21:54	Unode	alxgnon: you'd probably need some form of "catch all".
2015-06-30 12:22:05	minde	Elv1313: hey, have you tried to run a GLib.spawn_async_with_pipes() and timer together ?
2015-06-30 12:22:34	alxgnon	The dumbest, easiest solution I can think of is assigning empty functions to every single shortcut possible. It could be done programmatically. But I would prefer a smarter solution if it exists.

2015-06-30 20:35:17	Jikan	Hi. I just did a debian 8 fresh install, then installed awesome (reusing my "old" rc.lua) and I'm using 2 screens. It used to work very well but now, my wibox (I think it's how it's called) on the left screen overlaps the one of the right screen. Any clue?

2015-06-30 20:38:14	Jikan	Good question. I don't know but I don't think so, I was using latest ubuntu before.
2015-06-30 20:40:32	aajjbb	how do you run xrandr to call the other monitor ?
2015-06-30 20:43:07	Jikan	Custom command line at startup.

2015-06-30 20:44:54	aajjbb	can you show the snippet ? is it from the awesome wiki on using multiple monitors ?
2015-06-30 20:46:01	Jikan	It's not from awesome wiki. I use xrandr --output VGA-1 --mode 1440x900 --rate 75 --pos 0x0 --rotate right --output DVI-I-1 --primary --mode 2560x1440 --pos 900x0 --rotate normal

2015-07-02 05:17:34	Alissa	Awesome. :D
2015-07-02 05:17:38	konni	Alissa: try man awesome or read your rc.lua... the keybinds are quite readable
2015-07-02 05:17:55	konni	and the basic steps are well explained in man awesome
2015-07-02 05:18:02	konni	until you mess with the keybinds of course ;)
2015-07-02 05:18:02	Alissa	I must've passed over it. I spent quite a bit of time reading the rc.lua
2015-07-02 05:18:43	konni	yes its a lot at first
2015-07-02 05:18:55	konni	you get used to it though ;)
2015-07-02 05:20:13	Alissa	I tried to spread it out over multiple files once, like I do most things.
2015-07-02 05:20:26	Alissa	I quit after less than 1/3 of it.
2015-07-02 05:21:40	konni	you can do that, but then you have to remove the 'local' from the includes
2015-07-02 05:21:50	Alissa	Yeah, I was pretty much rewriting it.
2015-07-02 05:21:54	konni	and from some variables
2015-07-02 05:22:19	konni	i also did that... but now just put some functions in another file
