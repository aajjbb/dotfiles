2015-04-22 23:44:00	johnblood	no, why
2015-04-22 23:44:34	Zenther	[[[archtard]]], come fix my dd-wrt router, the connection/bridge/whatever drops after about 15 seconds
2015-04-22 23:44:50	[[[archtard]]]	you should be able to set it up how you like in the theme settings of xfce
2015-04-22 23:45:16	[[[archtard]]]	is it wireless Zenther? 
2015-04-22 23:45:25	Zenther	yes
2015-04-22 23:45:32	amonobeax	nvm I misunderstood something you said earlier
2015-04-22 23:45:32	Zenther	wireless bridge is what I want
2015-04-22 23:45:47	Zenther	wireless bridge to my other router next door
2015-04-22 23:45:49	[[[archtard]]]	do they have the same channel? that's usually the problem
2015-04-22 23:46:04	[[[archtard]]]	they need to be on the same
2015-04-22 23:46:22	Zenther	had it last year, took a day or two to get the settings, but when I went to iowa for a few months I changed them, now cannot get them back to a stable place
2015-04-22 23:46:37	Zenther	yes, both set to channel 4
2015-04-22 23:46:41	amonobeax	johnblood, so know the problem is on the laptop's display
2015-04-22 23:46:43	[[[archtard]]]	and if u have any cordless phones pick a channel nowhere near the same
2015-04-22 23:46:45	amonobeax	got it
2015-04-22 23:47:16	[[[archtard]]]	any neighbors close?
2015-04-22 23:47:25	Zenther	on my laptop watching the pings, it is fine, after 10-30 seconds, it drops, on the laptop if I tell networkmanager to turn it off and on, it is back
2015-04-22 23:47:27	johnblood	The top bar of each window should be black, not green. http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot2015-04-2222-22-02.php
2015-04-22 23:47:39	amonobeax	[[[archtard]]], what you say have you ever see anything like this ?
2015-04-22 23:47:43	johnblood	No matter what theme I use, it is still green.
2015-04-22 23:47:51	[[[archtard]]]	yeah that sounds like a congested channel to me
2015-04-22 23:48:02	Zenther	[[[archtard]]], my router (main) is actually in my neighbor's house
2015-04-22 23:48:16	amonobeax	humm
2015-04-22 23:48:41	amonobeax	have you tried the another window manager?
2015-04-22 23:48:47	[[[archtard]]]	crap their is a utility that can sniff the channels but I can't remember the name of it
2015-04-22 23:48:52	amonobeax	cause the bar seems to be ok bottom 
2015-04-22 23:48:52	Zenther	[[[archtard]]], not congestion... low signal though
2015-04-22 23:49:24	[[[archtard]]]	how far?
2015-04-22 23:49:32	Zenther	already looked, only about 2 other routers, not near channel
2015-04-22 23:49:51	[[[archtard]]]	yes but cordless phones talk on the same freq

2015-04-22 23:54:03	Zenther	before I had it in 'client' mode, separate ip range from other router, but now that one don't connect wifi to other router for some reason. In client bridge (routed) mode on same ip range it connects but drops after just a bit. I think it is the lan side dropping but not sure
2015-04-22 23:54:51	johnblood	i tried to pull it up, but it won't come up
2015-04-22 23:55:08	amonobeax	It didnt switch to other styles?
2015-04-22 23:55:24	amonobeax	none worked then?
2015-04-22 23:55:48	johnblood	the window manager dialog box did not come up

2015-04-23 00:10:29	amonobeax	what did you do
2015-04-23 00:11:05	amonobeax	what got buggy was the interaction between xfce and compiz

2015-04-24 13:03:11	Ebcore	_DiscipleOfDante: "Graphical Quality" is really a matter of taste, i don't think everyone tends to love transparency and bling bling effects. So even openbox still has persons who love it.

2015-04-24 13:04:54	+Jolt2bolt	EBcore, that's what i mean about "the piont of view" argument
2015-04-24 13:05:04	_DiscipleOfDante	The fonts, windows, panels, and everything looks very low res
2015-04-24 13:05:27	Ebcore	Openbox has no panels by itself.
2015-04-24 13:05:27	_DiscipleOfDante	Like if Plasma is 1080p and GNOME is 720p then OB looks like 480
2015-04-24 13:05:37	_DiscipleOfDante	I know
2015-04-24 13:05:49	_DiscipleOfDante	But there are no nice looking panels for it
2015-04-24 13:05:56	+Jolt2bolt	well i'm my pc look low res because I have an old monitor period that support low resolution!:p
2015-04-24 13:05:56	Ebcore	_DiscipleOfDante: I still don't get how you mean that. So you mean, the window borders of openbox are too small?
2015-04-24 13:06:02	_DiscipleOfDante	Ebcore: No
2015-04-24 13:06:07	_DiscipleOfDante	You can see the pixels too clearly

2015-04-25 19:32:30	Icabob4	Out of all of the linux distros, Ubuntu is the only one I've seen (besides Mac OSX, if you even count that), that goes against the fundamentals of Linux.

2015-04-25 19:36:02	Icabob4	If Canocal wants to make a phone OS, they shouldn't have it be labeled as the same thing as the Base OS, for example.
2015-04-25 19:36:41	Icabob4	Also, apt-get takes too many words to type out real commands.

2015-04-25 19:50:21	+ringo32	but the repo's manjaro maintain by there self
2015-04-25 19:50:31	+ringo32	obvious :)

2015-04-26 13:39:14	manots	i feel like very few pepole my age know that

2015-04-26 13:39:37	donkus	and a wifi network would show up on the scanned list of APs

2015-04-29 12:12:23	+Strit_Laptop	bobita, no, but it has an LTS kernel.
2015-04-29 12:12:41	bobita	Strit_Laptop, what that means?
2015-04-29 12:13:10	+Strit_Laptop	bobita, It means, that the kernel is supported for a very long time, if you install the LTS kernel.
2015-04-29 12:13:15	mtn	a lts version of a rolling distro? how would that work? :P
2015-04-29 12:13:31	_DiscipleOfDante	mtn: Not the whole distro
2015-04-29 12:13:38	_DiscipleOfDante	Just a kernel kept for LTS purposes

2015-04-29 12:14:05	bobita	Strit_Laptop, and how i install lts kernel?
2015-04-29 12:14:26	_DiscipleOfDante	mtn: Oh
2015-04-29 12:14:32	+Strit_Laptop	bobita, from manjaro settings manager
2015-04-29 12:14:36	_DiscipleOfDante	No yeah I COULD see how that would work though

2015-04-29 12:17:09	+Strit_Laptop	bobita, getting that kernel is pretty easy. You just open op manjaro settings manager, choose the kernel marked LTS (think 3.18 is), install it and reboot to use it.

2015-04-30 02:52:13	sky1	Vlado9A3CY: can you pls suggest when to do sudo pacman -S <package> or yaourt -S <package>
2015-04-30 02:52:28	sky1	im bit confused :p
2015-04-30 02:52:48	sky1	as im very new to Manjaro so cant ascertain 
2015-04-30 02:53:39	Vlado9A3CY	use pacman for manjaro packages and yaourt if you need something whato doesn't exist in manjaro repositories ...
2015-04-30 02:54:12	sky1	so how would i know if a particular package is not in manjaro repo ?
2015-04-30 02:54:17	Vlado9A3CY	yaourt installs packages from AUR (arch user repo) ... packages made by users
2015-04-30 02:55:04	Vlado9A3CY	if you try to install something with pacman and it doesn't exist, you'll see :)

2015-04-30 02:57:23	Vlado9A3CY	it would be a different story :)
2015-04-30 02:57:29	sky1	i see
2015-04-30 02:57:42	Vlado9A3CY	and with pacman always use sudo ...
2015-04-30 02:57:53	sky1	ok
2015-04-30 02:57:57	Vlado9A3CY	but do not use sudo with yaourt

2015-05-01 18:04:26	peaveyman	They work in my bios and in grub and if I have no login manager enabled I get to a login prompt where I can log in and work from the command line. But if I startx and get into kde or have the login manager enabled the mouse and keyboard stop working
2015-05-01 18:04:46	peaveyman	Is there a way to make startx start gnome instead of kde
2015-05-01 18:05:49	peaveyman	I have been running on a live cd since then. I'm almost to the point where I'm going to reinstall but don't want to 
2015-05-01 18:06:16	Zenther	had that happen with my logitech keyboard in 3.10, philm patched the kernel as the real kernel devs removed some shit
2015-05-01 18:06:47	+ringo32	Zenther,  he had a power shutdown, power failieur..
2015-05-01 18:07:00	+ringo32	since then ... some libs broke i think
2015-05-01 18:07:10	peaveyman	But this happened not during a kernel upgrade, it was a power failure at my house
2015-05-01 18:07:40	peaveyman	ringo32: I got all those errors fixed wihile in chroot
2015-05-01 18:08:14	Zenther	try reinstalling kernel?
2015-05-01 18:08:19	peaveyman	Everything upgraded nicely now but still no mouse or keyboard
2015-05-01 18:08:49	peaveyman	I am thinking about that but was wondering how a kernel I wasn't even running at the time could have gotten borked
2015-05-01 18:09:17	peaveyman	And like I said, it works fine if I diable sddm and boot to a prompt
2015-05-01 18:09:39	Zenther	check x settings

2015-05-02 11:31:32	Zenther	don't need them

2015-05-02 11:33:52	+ringo32	with that you can change some sources when needed and make a pkgbuild to make a package and install it

2015-05-02 11:47:37	peaveyman	ringo32: that's a thought also
2015-05-02 11:47:40	Zenther	for example, if you only had one partition install, you could use it to move your /home folder to new drive, edit fstab, reboot
2015-05-02 11:47:58	Zenther	or /var, etc... or... whole drive
2015-05-02 11:49:23	peaveyman	In this case it was mainly / because of the drivers so if I had backed it up I could have used rsync to put / back in it's orginal state?
2015-05-02 11:49:26	Zenther	it will 'clone' your current state, then you could just tar it up so it is in one huge file

2015-05-02 13:11:35	Thenewone	before trying to start iptables 
2015-05-02 13:11:43	Thenewone	i just intall it with sudo pacman -S iptables 
2015-05-02 13:11:54	Ebcore	well then it probably can't start because it has no rules
2015-05-02 13:12:10	Thenewone	just try to start it 
2015-05-02 13:12:19	Thenewone	sudo systemctl start iptables 
2015-05-02 13:12:27	Thenewone	it should have some rules ?
2015-05-02 13:12:44	Thenewone	because when i start my box i enable ufw 
2015-05-02 13:12:46	Ebcore	i don't know, i use ufw
2015-05-02 13:13:00	Thenewone	sudo ufw enable && ufw status
2015-05-02 13:13:03	donkus	is anyone else getting a bug in thunar like when you move a file by click and dragging it into a folder, all thunar windows crash?
2015-05-02 13:13:14	Thenewone	nope 
2015-05-02 13:13:17	Thenewone	for me no

2015-05-02 13:13:35	donkus	this must be reported
2015-05-02 13:13:46	donkus	I like thunar though
2015-05-02 13:13:48	Thenewone	is not for me

2015-05-02 13:14:22	donkus	they're webms, so they have thumbnails
2015-05-02 13:14:26	donkus	that could have something to do with it
2015-05-02 13:14:44	donkus	every time I watch one, I move it to the watched folder by dragging it with the mouse
2015-05-02 13:14:45	donkus	thanks Ebcore 
2015-05-02 13:16:07	Thenewone	to active iptable i should have some rules 
2015-05-02 13:16:27	Thenewone	lol
2015-05-02 13:16:42	Thenewone	to start the service you should creat # touch /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
2015-05-02 13:17:01	Ebcore	Thenewone: well, then touch the file as root
2015-05-02 13:17:06	donkus	wait a minute, both of these githubs (neilbrown, and hubx) haven't been updated for years
2015-05-02 13:17:18	Ebcore	hmm, okay

2015-05-02 13:21:35	Thenewone	i typed #systemctl enable iptables 
2015-05-02 13:21:45	peaveyman	Can the baloo file indexer be disabled. That critter keeps spiking my cpu for hours if I'm not sitting here

2015-05-02 13:24:36	donkus	perhaps they've already fixed it
2015-05-02 13:24:41	donkus	I may install thunar-git from the aur
2015-05-02 13:26:04	Ebcore	generally i wouldn't recommend installing git packages, and then from the aur, too.

2015-05-02 17:47:31	DiscipleOfDante	I mean, having to memorize and entire syntax is pointless and stupid if you ask me, you're never going to be without access to the docs for any programming language, so it would make more sense to teach students how to properly use existing docs and textbooks and enforce the way the language responds to basic programming concepts instead
2015-05-02 17:47:55	+ringo32	javier_,  look ok just check everything i gues bgut could try ?

2015-05-02 17:49:50	arkasizer	DiscipleOfDante, I give them a syntax cheat sheet and i'm lenient on that.  However, failing to implement a bubble search won't cut it
2015-05-02 17:50:15	DiscipleOfDante	Eh I never paid attention in data structures and algorithm analysis. It just gave me a headache.

2015-05-02 23:34:40	romo_sapien	What WM are you using? You said XFCE but that's just a DE.

2015-05-02 23:38:39	fioghual	reinstalling xfdesktop from pacman? like pacman -Su xfdesktop?
2015-05-02 23:39:11	romo_sapien	You don't need to have the "u" in there, but that should work
2015-05-02 23:39:25	fioghual	let's see.

2015-05-02 23:55:03	fioghual	i got the same after reboot
2015-05-02 23:55:20	romo_sapien	Do you have icons? Can you right-click on the desktop?
2015-05-02 23:56:04	fioghual	I think I saw a different message in the booting up. and some software are not working ... could it be permissions of the home folder?
2015-05-02 23:56:10	fioghual	no icons on the desktop
2015-05-02 23:56:24	romo_sapien	Are you able to right-click on the desktop?

2015-05-02 23:56:53	fioghual	nothing happens (and normally I get a menu)
2015-05-02 23:56:59	romo_sapien	Look in this file: ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml
2015-05-02 23:57:32	romo_sapien	Find the section that loads the xfdesktop. It should look something like this: (hold, uploading to pastebin)

2015-05-02 23:58:11	romo_sapien	Should look something like that. If it's not there, add it
2015-05-02 23:58:42	romo_sapien	Actually, before you do that, run this command
2015-05-02 23:58:47	romo_sapien	ps -aux | grep -e xfdesktop
2015-05-02 23:59:14	romo_sapien	That should return 2 lines. If it returns 1, then xfdesktop is not starting
2015-05-02 23:59:40	fioghual	one line only
2015-05-03 00:00:09	fioghual	the other one looks similar, but it has one extra line
2015-05-03 00:00:18	romo_sapien	?

2015-05-03 02:32:43	CountryfiedLinux	They're a bunch of crooks for sure. I'd rather not make anything at all than for them to screw over honest people the way they are.
2015-05-03 02:33:07	CountryfiedLinux	But I'll continue to make and upload videos in spite of Google.
2015-05-03 02:34:04	+uid1	Why not switch to Vimeo then?
2015-05-03 02:34:11	sh4n3	gotta love it,  i make videos from time to time and then set them all to private and the cycle goes one
2015-05-03 02:34:15	sh4n3	one / on
2015-05-03 02:34:29	CountryfiedLinux	uid1, And the world says "What's Vimeo?"
2015-05-03 02:34:42	CountryfiedLinux	I'm not familiar with it. I've heard of it.
2015-05-03 02:34:48	CountryfiedLinux	I've used Blip some too.
2015-05-03 02:35:01	sh4n3	i feel like Vimeo requires a BS in Film just to upload,  they are picky about content over there
2015-05-03 02:35:13	+uid1	Video hosting site.  Not sure what they specialize in.    ...   Ahh.
2015-05-03 02:35:41	+uid1	Bad Astronomer links to some amazing celestial videos there -- usually stunning time-lapse stuff.

2015-05-04 14:10:04	Manj-811-Xfce3	hello everyone. just did a clean install of manjaro 8.12 (nonfree, xfce). after the first boot i wanted to update the system. update-manager tells me "manjaro-system 20150314-1" with the size of 5 kib is available. i start the update process and in the popup window that shows informs about the progress it hangs at "gpg: a key is updated via hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net" (my translation of german). and there

2015-05-04 16:01:49	+ringo32	bumblebee is a switch with nomodeset you tell you will not switch between gpu i gues
2015-05-04 16:02:05	+Strit_Laptop	xTomyLEE, No. just "users" with the other options for your mount line in fstab.
2015-05-04 16:02:06	javier_	yes
2015-05-04 16:02:16	+ringo32	in this case bumblebee is the switcher to activate nvidia part
2015-05-04 16:02:27	javier_	aha
2015-05-04 16:02:34	thid	Strit_Laptop but for that its also good to set umask=000 and noauto
2015-05-04 16:03:01	+ringo32	i dont know you have nvidia option in the bios but i suspect is a acpi issue have to see proper and deeper on it
2015-05-04 16:03:10	+Strit_Laptop	sure is, but you can make do with "users". It's just not very secure.

2015-05-04 20:46:39	thid	Some devices have a regdomain set in firmware/EEPROM, which dictates the limits of the device, meaning that setting regdomain in software can only increase restrictions, not decrease them.

2015-05-04 22:15:05	coolthingy500	Just some tips about apt-get. If you guys have any ideas on how to improve apt-get speed. It's slower then pacman.
2015-05-04 22:15:24	Thenewone	then use pacman :)
2015-05-04 22:15:28	CountryfiedLinux	If you want the latest and greatest I'd suggest Arch. Debian is very unstable in that department but great as a server OS or the general desktop if you're content with slow but stable.
2015-05-04 22:15:47	coolthingy500	I don't mind old packages.
2015-05-04 22:16:04	CountryfiedLinux	Well then Debian may be for you coolthingy500 
2015-05-04 22:16:21	Thenewone	sudo apt-get install pacman :D
2015-05-04 22:16:27	Thenewone	nice game to spend time 
2015-05-04 22:16:41	coolthingy500	I can for some reason go both ways. But I am wondering if Apt-get is suppost to be slow n fetching updates.
2015-05-04 22:16:42	CountryfiedLinux	Or what about pacman -S apt-get haha :P
2015-05-04 22:16:45	coolthingy500	Lol

2015-05-04 22:17:40	coolthingy500	I still keep Manjaro and Arch

2015-05-04 22:18:09	Manj-811-Xfce	apt-get is just slow
2015-05-04 22:18:24	day|flip	apt-get is just stupidlly bad
2015-05-04 22:18:32	CountryfiedLinux	I too have noticed that things get installed faster with Pacman.
2015-05-04 22:18:33	coolthingy500	Oh. Okay I can live with that. I thought I broke my system.
2015-05-04 22:18:54	CountryfiedLinux	If it ain't broke fix it until it is :P
2015-05-04 22:18:58	coolthingy500	PPA are messy though.
2015-05-04 22:19:12	CountryfiedLinux	Relialbe PPA is nice to have and easy to find.
2015-05-04 22:19:20	Manj-811-Xfce	configure pacman to use wgat and rsync too lol
2015-05-04 22:20:11	coolthingy500	On Manjaro I ended up ditching yaourt. Too annoying to fix, and installed packer
2015-05-04 22:20:26	coolthingy500	Same with Arch
2015-05-04 22:20:55	day|flip	ahh
2015-05-04 22:20:57	Manj-811-Xfce	I dont think default AuR support is good, doesnt teach you anything

2015-05-04 22:21:24	coolthingy500	That's the Manjaro system I'm keeping.
2015-05-04 22:21:46	Thenewone	i'm using systemd 
2015-05-04 22:21:48	coolthingy500	OpenRC still beats systemd
2015-05-04 22:22:03	coolthingy500	IT's not looking good for systemd though.
2015-05-04 22:22:13	day|flip	Yes it does
2015-05-04 22:22:51	coolthingy500	This bugger conviced me to look at Debain

2015-05-04 22:23:04	day|flip	right now im using alt distro if manjaro every goes to the point were openrc can't be at any used anymore
2015-05-04 22:23:41	coolthingy500	I think as long as Gentoo wants to keep OpenRC. It's all good.
2015-05-04 22:24:02	coolthingy500	Unless the OpenRC team can't maintain it anymore.
2015-05-04 22:24:13	day|flip	i'm using something older then OpenRC and systemd but it faster then sysvinit

2015-05-04 22:35:09	day|flip	and you can have a chose if you want to stay pure 64bit or multi lib
2015-05-04 22:35:21	coolthingy500	Sound inticing.

2015-05-04 22:36:16	coolthingy500	Don't get me wrong Manjaro is my bread and butter as a second hand. But there is just a slew a distros to learn from.
2015-05-04 22:37:16	day|flip	tbh the only thing you really have to learn from a new distro is it package manager. that it main selling point on what make it different
2015-05-04 22:37:57	day|flip	and how it tell you what is right and what is wrong way
2015-05-04 22:38:48	day|flip	btw. bash is pure non tweek. you going have to change it to get it working simlly to manjaro. big head up
2015-05-04 22:39:10	coolthingy500	Good to know. I had to learn how to actually use Arch to use Arch.

2015-05-04 23:18:41	day|flip	and wm will stay around 5mib
2015-05-04 23:19:05	+uid1	WM doesn't come with a bunch of bundled utils, for one thing?
2015-05-04 23:19:13	+uid1	i.e. editor, file manager, etc...

2015-05-05 12:51:48	linux_dream	hi guys I've a question.  in pamac, I can see the orphan packages
2015-05-05 12:52:03	xTomyLEE	Mizu, since i type password way longer than my system boots, i dont care xD
2015-05-05 12:52:13	linux_dream	some of them have the name of programs that I use (example: git, chromium-pepper-flash, etc).  is it safe to remove them?
2015-05-05 12:52:48	ukbeast	are you using chromium?
2015-05-05 12:53:00	linux_dream	no I use firefox but I use the chromium pepper flash
2015-05-05 12:53:14	linux_dream	because the default flash for firefox gives me saccade videos on youtube

2015-05-05 12:54:37	linux_dream	no idea ukbeast , I followed the tutorial to install that version of flash on firefox
2015-05-05 12:54:42	linux_dream	I don't remember whwat I did
2015-05-05 12:54:52	linux_dream	the thing is that it works great
2015-05-05 12:55:17	linux_dream	also I use git.   so... if I remove the orphan packages I'll lose the ability to use git?
2015-05-05 12:55:47	ukbeast	you wan to keep git?
2015-05-05 12:55:52	ukbeast	*want
2015-05-05 12:56:22	ukbeast	hmm..
2015-05-05 12:56:42	linux_dream	I don't know
2015-05-05 12:56:49	linux_dream	I want to use the program git. yes
2015-05-05 12:57:03	linux_dream	I don't know if removing the package will uninstall it
2015-05-05 12:58:03	ukbeast	I don't know. I use ocotopi for my packages
2015-05-05 12:58:38	linux_dream	it doesn't matter.  with octopi I'd get the same list of orphan packages
2015-05-05 12:58:48	linux_dream	I see around 20 orphan packages
2015-05-05 12:59:01	linux_dream	to my surprise some of them look like programs that I use
2015-05-05 12:59:11	linux_dream	so I'm wondering whethere it's safe to delete them
2015-05-05 12:59:26	linux_dream	if not, why on Earth are they listed in orphan packages
2015-05-05 12:59:33	ukbeast	I never had had chromium-pepper as a orphan file. So I don't know
2015-05-05 12:59:48	linux_dream	what about git
2015-05-05 12:59:54	linux_dream	or cmake
2015-05-05 13:00:06	linux_dream	I have cmake as orphan package and I need it to compile stuff I guess

2015-05-06 12:45:47	DiscipleOfDante	Or panel launchers?
2015-05-06 12:45:52	Strit_Laptop_	yes. tray icons.

2015-05-06 12:46:24	DiscipleOfDante	You might want to run those last two in krunner

2015-05-06 12:46:43	Strit_Laptop_	Why isn't that installed by default in plasma-desktop?
2015-05-06 12:47:19	DiscipleOfDante	Strit_Laptop_: Plasma 5 dropped support for xembed as it is focused on Wayland compatibility
2015-05-06 12:47:30	DiscipleOfDante	sni gives you xembed support back, optionally
2015-05-06 12:47:39	DiscipleOfDante	This way Plasma has no hard dependencies on X
2015-05-06 12:48:02	Strit_Laptop_	Okay. And minimizing my hexchat just makes it disappear, since it's set to minimize to tray. Better turn that off then.

2015-05-06 23:35:54	CountryfiedLinux	linux_dream, lust look up google theme and it's called gtk-+1 or something like that
2015-05-06 23:36:23	linux_dream	oh nice
2015-05-06 23:36:30	linux_dream	much easier for me to install then
2015-05-06 23:36:56	linux_dream	I hardly understand why they modify existing themes.  they  broke my black theme (from the aur)
2015-05-06 23:37:19	linux_dream	one choses a theme because it's beautiful... and if someone totally modifies the color it's game over

2015-05-07 15:12:33	DiscipleOfDante	NTFS is getting better, but you still need to have Winblows set to auto-defrag weekly

2015-05-07 18:48:09	thenewone	Zenther, give 2/2 pitlab

2015-05-07 18:48:20	DiscipleOfDante	But that muddy brown
2015-05-07 18:48:22	Mizu	I started it via sudo nvidia-settings
2015-05-07 18:48:30	Mizu	and after that I tried gksudo 
2015-05-07 18:48:46	CountryfiedLinux	Yes xstefen ?
2015-05-07 18:48:48	Zenther	sudo nvidia-settings should allow you to write the file
2015-05-07 18:49:06	Mizu	hmm
2015-05-07 18:49:07	+xstefen	CountryfiedLinux, 2 things
2015-05-07 18:49:15	+xstefen	1) If im running the preview, When it comes out officially, will I have to install Win7 to get the free upgrade back to official Win10?
2015-05-07 18:49:32	+xstefen	2) Did you get normal partition select options during install, or is it going to try to wipe out my drive
2015-05-07 18:49:53	Zenther	xstefen, is this #windows
2015-05-07 18:50:27	DiscipleOfDante	Zenther: They don't know what the parent is, so I'll hve to find out when I take her to the vet, assuming my GF can afford to ship her to me of course.
2015-05-07 18:50:34	Mizu	Zenther okay now it wortked!
2015-05-07 18:50:44	Mizu	do I need to do something else after that?
2015-05-07 18:50:55	Zenther	uh, reboot....
2015-05-07 18:51:02	Mizu	Okay perfect, thanks! 
2015-05-07 18:51:34	+xstefen	Zenther, Was I asking you?

2015-05-07 18:51:52	DiscipleOfDante	Ewwwwwwwwwwwwww stargate
2015-05-07 18:52:03	Mizu	Okay I wrote it wrong.. /etc/X11/xorg.conf.de/20-nvidia.conf isnt working, but xorg.conf.d is..
2015-05-07 18:52:10	+xstefen	Zenther, better yet, is this #dogs ?
2015-05-07 18:52:13	CountryfiedLinux	I dunno if the insider preview gets the final update or not. And I just deleted partitions and had it use everything. It gives you the option to choose which partition you want to use and has a partitioner.
2015-05-07 18:52:16	Zenther	no, ewwww, would be Babylon 5
2015-05-07 18:52:22	+xstefen	Dont be a hypocrite :]

2015-05-08 10:09:17	+negen	Zenther, if your in the usa and use t-mobile for cell phone service you can get a asus rtac68u for free 
2015-05-08 10:09:41	Zenther	pings fine for 10-30 seconds then drops (might say rerouting before hand)
2015-05-08 10:09:57	thid	maybe its dd-wrt problem ?
2015-05-08 10:10:10	thid	I had problems on dir-300, droping wifi etc

2015-05-08 10:13:08	+negen	the us version of the 1900 ac tp link is a bit trash 
2015-05-08 10:13:08	thid	most tplinks are good
2015-05-08 10:13:20	thid	most of them allow modding the board

2015-05-08 10:14:01	Zenther	dir-615's are supposed to be the shit for cheap ones, but again, it all depends on which model rendition... mine is dir-616i1
2015-05-08 10:14:26	thid	hmm...I'm to lazt go now and check what rev I got

I tried to get my other half into it a few years ago but I made the mistake of showing her the console and whatnot and that put her right off.  She prefers to just click away and have the OS pretty much take care of itself, ala Windows.  Most do that nowadays
2015-05-09 11:08:21	+Strit_Laptop	I installed osmc on my raspberry, as raspbmc got outdated and unsupported.

2015-05-09 11:21:00	leftoverspagetti	monitors and tvs are built differently and are known to have problems. 
2015-05-09 11:21:22	leftoverspagetti	have you tried using the free drivers instead of proprietary?
2015-05-09 11:21:31	Asdas	It was working fine just before I installed compiz 
2015-05-09 11:21:37	+jonathon	yeah, apparently it worked "before". i still think it's a setting on the TV

2015-05-09 14:23:01	Manj-811-Xfce	now it seems fine,at least terminal tells me that there is nothing to do
2015-05-09 14:23:34	manjaromojo	i think i got that too and then more updates showed up.. lol

2015-05-09 14:40:14	+jonathon	two choices:
2015-05-09 14:40:17	+jonathon	1, use chrome

2015-05-09 19:21:00	Dobo	yeah, but it's got a monitor window.  It's rather cool
2015-05-09 19:22:22	+uid1	Quassel looks okay.  Now that Konversation has started sucking, I may have to switch.
2015-05-09 19:23:24	Dobo	if you're on KDE already I thoroughly recommend it
2015-05-09 19:23:26	Dobo	it's in the AUR
2015-05-09 19:23:35	Dobo	just make sure you get the monolithic version
2015-05-09 19:24:14	Dobo	is cinnamon stable on arch/manjaro now?
2015-05-09 19:24:20	Dobo	was a big buggy last time I used it
2015-05-09 19:24:24	+uid1	I've been quite happy with Konversation, until the recent version linked against the new framework.  Features missing now.  So I downgraded, but will definitely remember Quassel.
2015-05-09 19:24:30	Dobo	just turned v2.0 I think

2015-05-09 19:26:55	+uid1	Dobo: Does Quassel current link against the new KDE framework?
2015-05-09 19:27:05	+uid1	i.e. does it have flat menus, etc. ?
2015-05-09 19:28:56	Dobo	udl, no idea sorry.  there wasn't even a new framework in the pipeline when I last tried it
2015-05-09 19:29:02	Dobo	I'm not a fan of KDE
2015-05-09 19:29:29	Dobo	I don't dislike it, I just prefer gnome based stuff
2015-05-09 19:29:48	+uid1	In the new framework, everything's flat - menus have no shadow under them, etc.    Seems like everyone's doing it these days...

2015-05-09 20:10:58	Spec-Chum	KDE, I like the DE but I'm too used to gnome apps, so not much point.  Gnome Shell - I'm missing a window list plus it's a bit...bland.  MATE, too primative, same for LXDE and Xfce.
2015-05-09 20:11:15	+ringo32	Manj-811-Xfce,  im more a viber freak never used telegram
2015-05-09 20:12:52	Spec-Chum	eww, no offence to whoever made the theme, but the default cinnamon is a bit..green
2015-05-09 20:13:09	Manj-811-Xfce	i see,nevermind,everybody got its preferences.i prefer telegram due to it's openness and it is just so frustrating that i am not able to perform a clean install of it.

2015-05-10 12:58:47	[thor]	linux_dream, try "which fixit"

2015-05-10 12:59:38	linux_dream	so I don't have the "executable" ?

2015-05-10 13:04:54	+jonathon	i hate that alias ... -.-
2015-05-10 13:05:08	linux_dream	why? because it takes a long time to run?

2015-05-10 13:05:18	+Lukimya	if running on stable, the allservers.sh is pretty handy too
2015-05-10 13:05:25	+Lukimya	that should be in AUR
2015-05-10 13:05:35	+jonathon	it doesn't check whether pacman is already running, so it could end up screwing the package database

2015-05-10 13:07:26	+jonathon	another crazy design choice, imho
2015-05-10 13:07:28	linux_dream	the thing is, pacman is locked a lot of times evne though it's not running or so
2015-05-10 13:07:44	linux_dream	I started having this problem like 3 or 4 months ago

2015-05-10 13:11:03	[thor]	because if you are using fixit it is because the lock is stuck

2015-05-10 13:12:46	+jonathon	right, so the fix shouldn't be to add a random bash alias
2015-05-10 13:12:58	+jonathon	it should be to stop whatever is failing, from failing
2015-05-10 13:13:05	[thor]	i agree.
2015-05-10 13:13:39	linux_dream	I'm guessing it's a bug that was introduced in pacman or so...

2015-05-10 13:41:24	+jonathon	there are easier ways of sharing folders between virtualbox guest and host
2015-05-10 13:41:44	Asdas	how ? I tried so much but virtualbox isnt showing anything
2015-05-10 13:41:56	+jonathon	samba isn't easy to use because the host-guest networking isn't the normal way of doing things
2015-05-10 13:42:10	+jonathon	look up virtualbox shared folders
2015-05-10 13:43:25	Asdas	I did but things like "net use..." arent working 
2015-05-10 13:43:45	Asdas	and the cmd in windows isnt showing anything when I type in ipconfig
2015-05-10 13:44:06	+jonathon	i don't know what commands you're using
2015-05-10 13:44:26	Asdas	net use x: \\vboxsvr\share
2015-05-10 13:44:29	+jonathon	but normally, you create a shared folder in the virtualbox guest settings
2015-05-10 13:44:32	+jonathon	this shows up in the windows guest under \\vboxsrv
2015-05-10 13:44:46	Asdas	I did that but its not showing up :(
2015-05-10 13:45:03	+jonathon	and under linux you have to mount -t vboxfs share /mount

2015-05-10 17:28:59	+jonathon	a simple rsync to an external drive might do

2015-05-13 11:12:58	peetaur2	md5 is so broken ... that's just stupid. For example http://natmchugh.blogspot.de/2014/10/images-with-colliding-md5-hash.html

2015-05-13 21:41:39	oleerik	I might be missing something very obvious here.

2015-05-13 21:44:46	+xstefen	npm is one of very few cases if not the only that npm > pacman for its packages

2015-05-14 13:24:24	Zenther	it has ONLY been 2 years and 10 months since 2.10 to get to 2.12
2015-05-14 13:24:36	Zenther	cinnamon
2015-05-14 13:24:40	Hairo	plasma 5 is quite nice
2015-05-14 13:24:57	Hairo	if you got enough RAM
2015-05-14 13:25:02	Zenther	bloat *cough* boat *cough*
2015-05-14 13:25:05	colbyftp	I can't get on with plasma its looks faded, white washed something. I dont get it

2015-05-14 13:26:29	Hairo	i just can't be without krunner
2015-05-14 13:26:34	Zenther	biggest issue with cinnamon is gtk updates break it on each major release

2015-05-15 12:58:50	NolanSyKinsley	How can I constrain java's memory usage, it keeps reserving more and more and more until it eats up all my memory and starts pushing everything to swap. Yes, I set java's command line memory. even when set to 1 gig, and from in game it appears to only use that, but it's process keeps swallowing more ram
2015-05-15 12:59:16	NolanSyKinsley	I even tried rlimit as shown here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Realtime_process_management
2015-05-15 12:59:29	zaggynl	what game?
2015-05-15 12:59:30	NolanSyKinsley	set a hard limit at 2 gigs, but it still surpasses
2015-05-15 12:59:34	NolanSyKinsley	minecraft ofc
2015-05-15 12:59:41	NolanSyKinsley	only java game I know really

2015-05-15 13:00:56	NolanSyKinsley	even in visualvm it shows that the game is holding steady at memory usage

2015-05-15 23:17:09	thenewone	what is the easy one to start with i'm sure desktop 
2015-05-15 23:17:37	Zenther	The grsecurity kernel provides many security-related improvements. It hardens both the kernel and userspace against common memory corruption vulnerabilities, along with providing many miscellaneous features and a role-based access control system. It is the only way to secure the kernel itself against exploitation, which is the most important improvement for a system already making good use of user isolation, containers/chroots and sandboxes.
2015-05-15 23:18:46	thenewone	thanks about the link Zenther 
2015-05-15 23:19:04	Q-collective	grsecurity is also mostly sensical for servers

2015-05-15 23:51:50	CountryfiedLinux	It's just frustrating to have such high hopes the week before and this week the co-hosts don't show. And I can't even beg people to go on, which would most likely be a regret being that I don't even know if they'd be any good for the show. Perhaps I'm just wasting my time. If nobody else cares then I don't.
2015-05-15 23:52:29	CountryfiedLinux	I'm gonna make a video in regards to what's next. I'm gonna wait until I'm not upset and I can talk about things objectively.

2015-05-16 14:24:14	fabulouSSuperbia	because you either install arch by hand (which takes 5 minutes when you are into it), or you install manjaro
2015-05-16 14:24:35	manots	bia it takes a hour and 30 of pulling your hair out
2015-05-16 14:24:45	fabulouSSuperbia	also when shit break in arch, you cant just ask on #archlinux, because people there are unfriendly

2015-05-17 03:21:54	shndns	when did gnome3 come out?
2015-05-17 03:22:14	+ringo32	what features ?
2015-05-17 03:22:30	+ringo32	what must a common user have ?
2015-05-17 03:22:46	+ringo32	all you need is hexchat and #manjaro

2015-05-17 03:23:24	ggr	well, dual panes are missing in thunar.. i like the way to add and remove desktops in cinnamon, the expose kind of thing.. these are missing in xfce
2015-05-17 03:24:01	shndns	I don't even use manjaro.

2015-05-17 03:25:52	ggr	integration with thunar is pretty much the point of xfce
2015-05-17 03:26:29	ggr	and i can circumvent the missing dual panes by means of tiling two thunar windows.. tiling in xfce works nice
2015-05-17 03:27:16	+ringo32	ggr,  there is a thunar with splitview

2015-05-18 23:02:53	stevelitt	Zenther, I knew there was a reason I used Openbox :-)
2015-05-18 23:03:48	Zenther	I think it is funny when newbs want to try openbox and just don't understand that it is just a wm
2015-05-18 23:04:17	stevelitt	Zenther, Openbox is useless unless you put in your own hotkeys and other customizations. Out of the box, useless.
2015-05-18 23:04:42	Zenther	I didn't care for it, I am a traditional de guy. I want a start button and an interactive status bar/icon tray
2015-05-18 23:04:44	stevelitt	Openbox + dmenu + customization = productivity
2015-05-18 23:05:07	stevelitt	Zenther, have you ever used dmenu?
2015-05-18 23:05:21	Zenther	hate right clicking the desktop for a menu
2015-05-18 23:06:07	stevelitt	No need to *ever* right click the desktop. A hotkey brings up dmenu, and three to five keystrokes runs the program. Greased lightning in the hands of a touch typist who types over 35 words per minute.
2015-05-18 23:06:42	Zenther	still want a mouse way to do it easily
2015-05-18 23:07:08	stevelitt	And, just for the mouse types, Openbox allows you to put a tiny margin on an end or top or bottom so that a tiny piece of the desktop is available.
2015-05-18 23:07:13	Zenther	hate moving my hands back and forth, if I am at the keyboard, I prefer to stay there and will use hotkeys
2015-05-18 23:07:41	Zenther	same in reverse
2015-05-18 23:07:48	stevelitt	Yes! If I'm on the mouse, I stay there. If keyboard, I stay there. Switching is so slow.
2015-05-18 23:09:00	Zenther	I should try enlightenment 19 on gentoo box, I haven't tried it since 17 first came out and was unimpressed as it was buggy as all get out and incomplete
2015-05-18 23:09:21	stevelitt	I'll use anything but Gnome and KDE.
2015-05-18 23:09:32	Zenther	enlightenment is surprisingly customizable and pretty for its size of install
2015-05-18 23:09:47	stevelitt	And WindowMaker, which I've failed to understand after 15 years trying.

2015-05-18 23:10:35	stevelitt	LOL, dwm plus st might beat it.
2015-05-18 23:10:45	Zenther	I was in twm about an hour ago believe it or not
2015-05-18 23:11:00	stevelitt	dwm is Suckless Tools' window manager, and st is their no frills terminal.
2015-05-18 23:11:14	stevelitt	I'll have to re-try twm. How do you like it?
2015-05-18 23:11:18	Zenther	just the fastest way to test x11
2015-05-18 23:11:28	Zenther	that's all I use it for
2015-05-18 23:11:31	stevelitt	I'll have to try it.
2015-05-18 23:11:42	Zenther	if it startx fine, then I exit and remove it
2015-05-18 23:11:48	stevelitt	By the way, if you want lightweight but want a start menu and panel, look at jwm.

2015-05-18 23:13:00	NolanSyKinsley	I made something kinda nice-ish for populating openboxe's menu with the games you own in steam (getting the icons was a little more difficult that what should be considered sane) https://github.com/NolanSyKinsley/Obmenu-SteamPipe
2015-05-18 23:14:00	Zenther	saw an icon set somewhere for steam games
2015-05-18 23:14:14	Zenther	in the last few days in fact

2015-05-18 23:18:56	Zenther	I need to look into slowing down a systemd unit file
2015-05-18 23:19:28	stevelitt	How does one slow down a systemd unit file? It's not a script you can put a sleep into.
2015-05-18 23:19:46	stevelitt	Maybe they have a variable for delay.
2015-05-18 23:20:01	Zenther	mythtvbackend.service loads before my card has uploaded its firmware and causes mythtv to always say "All tuners are currently busy." until I restart the mythbackend
2015-05-18 23:20:16	NolanSyKinsley	Lol, I love that font toom it is called purisia.. I actually got so many complaints about the font that I changed it, I decided to "steamify" openbox and make everything their signature gray/blue and am now using the same font as steam which is ariel I believe.
2015-05-18 23:20:35	Zenther	well, some you can have it delay until another is up I know... like relying on network and stuff
2015-05-18 23:20:48	stevelitt	LOL, this was exactly the use case trumpeted as the reason for systemd: It has socket activation and complete dependency checking.

2015-05-19 12:43:17	+Strit_Laptop	conclusion on owncloud so far: I'll likely use it, when I get a good internet connection. But for now, I'll stick with Dropbox.
2015-05-19 12:44:25	tomylee	isnt owncloud like ftp server?
2015-05-19 12:44:38	tomylee	which u can hold on ur pc for example.
2015-05-19 12:44:44	+Strit_Laptop	tomylee, it's more like your own private dropbox service.
2015-05-19 12:45:20	tomylee	but dropbox isnt like your own private server right ?
2015-05-19 12:45:41	+Strit_Laptop	tomylee, correct. Dropbox is a cloud service, from a company.
2015-05-19 12:46:01	tomylee	ok. so basicaly u are comparing two different things xD
2015-05-19 12:46:38	+Strit_Laptop	tomylee, well, it's not using FTP protocol so that's not a comparison either. the closest thing is probably dropbox.

2015-05-19 16:50:40	fes	Strit_Laptop, I have compiled a lot of packages myself so I am not really up to date and therefore I needed to reinstall pamac and couldn't find the old version in manjaro's repo.

2015-05-19 16:51:28	edge226	manots: you can try it but funtoo is going to require a lot of learning. it is gentoo based.
2015-05-19 16:51:41	+Strit_Laptop	fes, pamac 3.2-2. :)
2015-05-19 16:52:07	fes	not 2.3-3 ?

2015-05-19 16:54:37	fes	I had pamac 2.2.2-1 before and when I accidentally upgraded to 2.3-3 I needed new versions of gnutls, nettle among other and then my chromium did not start and tonight I do not feel like compiling chromium again. That is why I had to fix pamac somehow and then reinstall older versions of gntuls and nettle again,

2015-05-19 16:55:25	fes	Strit_Laptop, but do you think I can cause a lot of problem by telling PKGBUILD that it only needed gnutls 3.3 and not 3.4 which it originally stated?

2015-05-19 21:56:38	Zenther	or I should say to gpt
2015-05-19 21:58:26	day|flip	this is why im scard of getting a uefi. it sound like a pain in the ass to set the partition right
2015-05-19 21:58:51	Zenther	meh, terminology is what is just hard to grasp
2015-05-19 21:59:21	Zenther	it really isn't hard and actually a nice way to implement things and get legacy mbr/bios out of our way
2015-05-19 21:59:30	Zenther	with their limitations they have
2015-05-19 21:59:51	day|flip	ya but too many partition
2015-05-19 21:59:54	Zenther	problem is there is no 'standard' way it is implemented
2015-05-19 22:00:48	Zenther	hey, if I have a 6tb disk, it would be nice to have a lot of partitions and install different distro's or windows on it
2015-05-19 22:00:53	day|flip	for me i need swap. i can go without /boot partition. to me /boot partition is really not needed
2015-05-19 22:01:17	Zenther	that still isn't enough if you like to have multiple distros
2015-05-19 22:01:23	thenewone	cool i'm installing the system again

2015-05-20 06:32:59	Spec-Chum	your display manager will dictate what you do after that tho
2015-05-20 06:33:47	thid	ajrossnz that what happens when u use gui craps for pacman
2015-05-20 06:33:57	+Strit_Laptop	ajrossnz, It's a bug in the last install media 0.8.12. Should be fixed in 0.8.13.

2015-05-20 06:35:01	ajrossnz	cool. I'm happy using the pacman on cli - haven't touched the gui, honest! anyway am I safe to just delete the lock and start going ahead?

2015-05-20 06:46:54	peetaur2	but my opinion, ajrossnz, is that pacman is way faster and simpler, pkgbuild is also very simple and easy to control and edit compared to rpmbuild and the mysterious hard to find documentation for apt thing; and apt uses stupid hacks to do some dependencies which makes it terrible (like some packages require a specific kernel because there is no way to say >= since the kernels are separate packages, not different versions of the same 
2015-05-20 06:46:55	peetaur2	package), and pacman supposedly lacks some of those features but gets by mostly cleanly without it.
2015-05-20 06:47:37	peetaur2	but also it somehow seems common that people have this pacman locking issue... I guess from the guis, and other systems don't have that as much. (I have only seen it once maybe on ubuntu, caused by out of space and then killing the processes)

2015-05-20 09:16:04	+jonathon	bit late, last time i tried sharing Steam files between a Windows and Linux client (i.e. having the same download directory, not shared over a network) games would constantly re-download as they would fail the validity check when downloaded by the other client. So, load Windows Steam, download game. Quit. Load Linux client, Steam re-downloads game files.
2015-05-20 09:17:35	brainwash	it re-downloads the exact same files?
2015-05-20 09:17:56	+jonathon	yup

2015-05-20 10:49:34	peetaur2	nelgior: the problem I am talking about with nouveau is easily found in syslog, and is the fault of the hw vendor having closed proprietary crap, and the open driver being reverse engineered so it is open source but not compatible with all hw

2015-05-20 11:04:02	+jonathon	initrd (hd0,7)/boot/initramfs-318-i686.img <- is the wrong initramfs
2015-05-20 11:04:05	+jonathon	initrd (hd0,7)/boot/initramfs-3.18-i686.img <- should be this
2015-05-20 11:04:45	saleem	http://pastie.org/10198721
2015-05-20 11:05:14	+jonathon	that sows the wrong format for the initramfs file name
2015-05-20 11:05:18	saleem	you can see the entries for different oses, they are all set in same way and they all boot except manjaro
2015-05-20 11:05:23	+jonathon	there's a '.' in it now
2015-05-20 11:05:30	+jonathon	ffs
2015-05-20 11:05:32	+jonathon	initrd (hd0,7)/boot/initramfs-318-i686.img <- is the wrong initramfs
2015-05-20 11:05:33	+jonathon	initrd (hd0,7)/boot/initramfs-3.18-i686.img <- should be this
2015-05-20 11:05:56	+jonathon	not 318
2015-05-20 11:05:57	+jonathon	3.18
2015-05-20 11:05:59	+jonathon	yes?
2015-05-20 11:06:48	saleem	yes i will change it to 3.18
2015-05-20 11:06:51	saleem	but
2015-05-20 11:07:14	saleem	why in first place it kept booting previously even it was 318
2015-05-20 11:07:20	saleem	isnt this strnage
2015-05-20 11:07:32	+jonathon	kernel got an update so the initramfs was regenerated
2015-05-20 11:07:46	+jonathon	dots have been added so there's no ambiguity with kernel 4
2015-05-20 11:07:48	saleem	becauase as i said i did not change anything in grub line of manjaro
2015-05-20 11:07:54	+jonathon	40, 41, 410
2015-05-20 11:07:59	saleem	ah
2015-05-20 11:08:09	saleem	so this is the new thing
2015-05-20 11:08:17	+jonathon	relatively
2015-05-20 11:08:23	saleem	great
2015-05-20 11:08:44	saleem	so the whole universe went wrong because of one dot :)

2015-05-20 11:09:40	+jonathon	and your custom grub menu
2015-05-20 11:09:41	saleem	will boot and check if things are bak in order due to that one dot or not
2015-05-20 11:09:42	+jonathon	:P
2015-05-20 11:10:03	saleem	yes custom things need to be re-customed manually
2015-05-20 11:10:18	saleem	but thanks it solved the issue
2015-05-20 11:10:27	saleem	need reboot to check 
2015-05-20 11:10:27	+jonathon	you're welcome :)
2015-05-20 11:10:38	+jonathon	now delete all of those other OS and stick with just Manjaro

2015-05-20 11:21:42	zeebuttons	Helllo! I've been using manjaro for couple of months now and I was thinking about reinstalling my whole system but there seems to be an issue with grub booting usb..I boot my usb and get to the grub screen but after i select the first option all I get is black screen. Same thing happens with arch iso aswell...I never had any troubles before and have no idea how to find out whats causing the problems. Any ideas?
2015-05-20 11:23:28	manja	yes
2015-05-20 11:24:05	manja	how do you use grub to load the live cd
2015-05-20 11:24:11	manja	just curious
2015-05-20 11:24:14	zeebuttons	its the grub from live cd
2015-05-20 11:24:45	zeebuttons	i just formated the drive and dd-ed image..the usual stuff..
2015-05-20 11:24:58	manja	even archlinux live iso ?

2015-05-20 11:26:37	+jonathon	zeebuttons: did you try different boot options, e.g. free drivers?
2015-05-20 11:26:55	+jonathon	did you try 'no acpi' under advanced (f4 i think?)
2015-05-20 11:26:57	zeebuttons	jonathon: tried both..usually just go with free drivers anyway while installing
2015-05-20 11:27:00	peetaur2	zeebuttons: formatted the one you dded it to? don't do that.. just dd to the raw whole device

2015-05-20 11:27:30	zeebuttons	peetaur2: I know..I don't write it to partition..just saying i formated it and created a new partition table just in case

2015-05-20 11:28:41	+jonathon	e.g. 0.8.12?
2015-05-20 11:29:00	manja	318 is not fine for hp/compaq laptops
2015-05-20 11:29:01	peetaur2	so 3.18 seems the longest current lts

2015-05-20 11:31:44	+jonathon	yup
2015-05-20 11:31:50	+jonathon	you might have found a bug :)
2015-05-20 11:32:05	zeebuttons	my first guess is kernel version
2015-05-20 11:32:19	zeebuttons	but have no clue how  to check if thats the problem or not
2015-05-20 11:32:27	zeebuttons	don't even know the kernel the iso is using
2015-05-20 11:32:32	+jonathon	which version did you have running before? 3.16
2015-05-20 11:32:42	+jonathon	i think the 0.8.12 is using 3.18 (but i could be wrong)
2015-05-20 11:32:58	zeebuttons	just a sec
2015-05-20 11:32:58	+jonathon	oh no, that's rubbish
2015-05-20 11:33:02	+jonathon	0.8.12 is using 3.16
2015-05-20 11:33:05	zeebuttons	let me see whats running there
2015-05-20 11:33:06	+jonathon	duh
2015-05-20 11:33:38	zeebuttons	3.18
2015-05-20 11:33:44	zeebuttons	working perfectly
2015-05-20 11:34:05	zeebuttons	think i tried going to 4 but got black screen on boot
2015-05-20 11:34:12	zeebuttons	if its 3.16 it should work
2015-05-20 11:34:16	zeebuttons	so its not the kernel then

2015-05-20 11:45:02	+jonathon	now then
2015-05-20 11:45:05	zeebuttons	one of the firsts

2015-05-20 11:46:28	+jonathon	but there was a change to the handling of UEFI around 0.8.12 release
2015-05-20 11:46:36	+jonathon	arch had the exact same issues
2015-05-20 11:47:10	zeebuttons	hmm
2015-05-20 11:47:18	zeebuttons	so basicly reinstall grub on usb
2015-05-20 11:47:22	zeebuttons	i could try that
2015-05-20 11:47:52	Zenther	install disks don't use grub, they use syslinux
2015-05-20 11:47:56	+jonathon	did you try nomodeset?

2015-05-20 11:49:25	stevelitt	Zenther, I got Manjaro OpenRC 8.12 running with full GUI on Virtualbox even though it wouldn't display GUI (startx) using Qemu. I have no explanation, but at least I have a way to work with it, so that's a good thing.
2015-05-20 11:49:55	+jonathon	well, it's home time for me

2015-05-20 11:51:51	+jonathon	e.g. alsamixer
2015-05-20 11:51:57	+jonathon	and f6 to switch cards
2015-05-20 11:51:57	saleem	ok
2015-05-20 11:52:22	Zenther	zeebuttons, how are you creating the boot usb out of curiosity
2015-05-20 11:52:33	+jonathon	there are also some cards that need specific modprobe options (e.g. my dell 1749 needs dell-dmic or something like that)

2015-05-20 12:00:43	zeebuttons	Zenther: efi yeah
2015-05-20 12:00:59	Zenther	might check to see if it has bios legacy mode if you are not dual booting with it

2015-05-20 12:03:29	Zenther	whatever key to to edit bios/uefi settings on boot
2015-05-20 12:03:35	Zenther	have to look around in there for it

2015-05-20 13:45:21	poopzmeow	Hi. Can someone explain to me how manjaro's repo differ to archlinux's?
2015-05-20 13:45:48	poopzmeow	my freshly archlinux box has updates for $packages where a freshly installed manjaro hasn't.
2015-05-20 13:45:59	+Strit_Laptop	poopzmeow, they don't really differ other than a few packages.
2015-05-20 13:46:11	poopzmeow	Oh ok.
2015-05-20 13:46:14	+Strit_Laptop	poopzmeow, That's because your manjaro is on stable repo
2015-05-20 13:46:32	+Strit_Laptop	Which means they test the packages further before releasing them.
2015-05-20 13:46:49	+xstefen	cybermails, im not sure but i know what you're talking about
2015-05-20 13:46:58	+xstefen	some wicked stuff, had me looking over my shoulder haha

2015-05-20 13:47:37	+xstefen	poopzmeow, manjaro is behind arch
2015-05-20 13:47:43	+xstefen	for "stability" reasons
2015-05-20 13:48:23	poopzmeow	Strit_Laptop: xstefen: ic. Would you recommend to use other stages as repos than stable, like 'testing'?
2015-05-20 13:48:34	+xstefen	testing is closer to arch
2015-05-20 13:48:54	+Strit_Laptop	poopzmeow, that depends on what you need. If you want fast updates use unstable. Else just stay on stable .)
2015-05-20 13:48:55	+xstefen	I typically use testing when I run manjaro, not major issues
2015-05-20 13:48:55	cybermails	xstefen: lol. Binaural sound is just true 3d sound
2015-05-20 13:48:56	poopzmeow	I'm just curious because I'd like to have an update for my browser (chrome) because of the current Logjam-Vuln. :|

2015-05-20 13:49:26	+xstefen	not in standard repos
2015-05-20 13:49:30	+xstefen	AUR should be identical
2015-05-20 13:49:32	poopzmeow	Yea, I know.
2015-05-20 13:49:35	+Strit_Laptop	Chrome is from AUR, so that should always be the version of Arch's
2015-05-20 13:50:01	poopzmeow	It says everything is up2date but I'm in doubt.
2015-05-20 13:50:17	+xstefen	yaourt -Syua

2015-05-20 13:50:56	poopzmeow	What is the 'a' doing?
2015-05-20 13:51:01	+Strit_Laptop	poopzmeow, you can check the AUR page for Chrome, to see the version, and if its flagged out of date.
2015-05-20 13:51:18	+Strit_Laptop	poopzmeow, the "a" takes AUR packages aswell

2015-05-20 16:50:09	arkasizer	My first batch of freshman summer students are in for some hell lol
2015-05-20 16:50:27	arkasizer	I'm officially using Manjaro as a teaching tool in my CSCI 3030 class
2015-05-20 16:50:40	thid	gj!
2015-05-20 16:50:44	+xstefen_	:D
2015-05-20 16:50:50	thid	tell them to use netinstall to setup system

2015-05-20 16:51:18	arkasizer	Zenther, LFS is hell lol
2015-05-20 16:51:36	bombota	hello guys. i'm getting mouse freezes after a hibernate. also happens on boot sometimes. if i swap usb port for the mouse, then it will work for the rest of my session.any thoughts? amd fx 6300, asrock mb, msi 750ti graphics card. currently on the unstable repo,but it was happening on stable too.
2015-05-20 16:51:46	Zenther	arkasizer, only if you want to keep it updated
2015-05-20 16:51:47	thid	2 weeks for that?! it should be no more then 2hrs
2015-05-20 16:51:50	manots	isnt that just assembly and c?
2015-05-20 16:51:54	arkasizer	I finally talked my dept. into switching to Manjaro, because our pearson textbooks keep using updated packages that Ubuntu doesn't have a lot of times.
2015-05-20 16:52:16	arkasizer	Zenther, Indeed, all that compiling will be a mess
2015-05-20 16:52:36	arkasizer	thid, Most of these students know nothing of linux

2015-05-20 16:54:27	Zenther	sounds like something is putting your mouse to sleep power wise

2015-05-21 11:45:05	+negen	arch on a server would not be bad if you used he blacklist for certain files that are known to bork a system

2015-05-21 11:46:11	+negen	manjaro is fine and all but not as good as it used to be

2015-05-21 11:46:31	Future_Suture	negen, how has it gotten worse?
2015-05-21 11:46:46	+negen	too much automation 
2015-05-21 11:46:56	Reepicheep	and on home systems I do that very thing.  It's different if it is running local DNS and a mythtv backend for my family then if it is running a production mail server
2015-05-21 11:47:04	Future_Suture	Reepicheep, have you looked at openSUSE Tumbleweed?
2015-05-21 11:47:43	peetaur2	why opensuse? manjaro solves the stability issues, but also is still pacman, etc.
2015-05-21 11:48:05	+negen	if i use manjaro i still use the old installation iso's that carl made 
2015-05-21 11:48:10	peetaur2	I came from openSUSE ... used it for more than 10 years ... left it due to systemd, and I like manjaro better :)
2015-05-21 11:48:33	Future_Suture	peetaur2, what Reepicheep described just sounded like openSUSE Tumbleweed might fit.
2015-05-21 11:48:36	+negen	arch has been on my laptop for almost two years and I never had a stability issue

2015-05-21 11:50:20	Reepicheep	I wouldn't call stability of the system the issues I have had with Arch.  It's bugs that sneak in that cause annoyances in applications
2015-05-21 11:50:21	peetaur2	does he want it on a server? then I would not use either tumbleweed or any rolling release
2015-05-21 11:51:03	Reepicheep	and BTW, I never meant to start a "discussion" on that could be taken as a distro war
2015-05-21 11:51:55	Reepicheep	peetaur2, I agree and that is why I'm not planning on changing any of my servers I am professionally responsible for anytime soon ;)
2015-05-21 11:52:04	peetaur2	it's not a war unless it's just subjective ranting instead of some well stated requirements and why something is suitable
2015-05-21 11:52:23	peetaur2	Reepicheep: what do they run now?
2015-05-21 11:52:31	Reepicheep	I learned the hard way with Gentoo years ago.  And I absolutely love the Gentoo system
2015-05-21 11:52:35	peetaur2	you said arch but ... wouldn't that be much worse than manjaro? :D
2015-05-21 11:53:07	+negen	I find gentoo to be rather stable 
2015-05-21 11:53:18	+negen	but time consuming to setup 
2015-05-21 11:53:27	peetaur2	is gentoo a rolling sort of model though? that's why you can't put it on a stable server
2015-05-21 11:53:43	peetaur2	surprise... you have to rewrite all your conf files, but we won't tell you which ones! ;)
2015-05-21 11:53:50	peetaur2	s/all//
2015-05-21 11:54:55	Reepicheep	negen, that is excatly part of the issue with rolling distros,  they absolutely can be stable it just takes more time for the local sysadmin to do things correctly
2015-05-21 11:55:13	+negen	i tend to use as little as needed to get what needs to get done with a server done 
2015-05-21 11:55:24	peetaur2	yes more time.... which is more costly
2015-05-21 11:55:27	peetaur2	certainly possible if you plan on doing a full test before every upgrade
2015-05-21 11:56:08	+negen	our servers used embedded jails based off of redhat 
2015-05-21 11:56:22	+negen	they are run off of cf cards 
2015-05-21 11:56:50	peetaur2	that doesn't sound right... I don't think cf cards have proper wear leveling... or do some?
2015-05-21 11:56:57	+negen	if i need to upgrade I need approval from the state and then I just replace the cf cards 
2015-05-21 11:57:21	Reepicheep	negen, one of the great things with using Redhat is that thay do all this time consuming testing that we normally would have to do
2015-05-21 11:57:47	+negen	i am not sure what ware leveling is 
2015-05-21 11:57:51	Reepicheep	and we just sit back enjoy the benefits and take them for grated ;)
2015-05-21 11:58:07	+negen	but are system is completely isolated from any outside network 
2015-05-21 11:58:11	peetaur2	negen: like trim/discard on an SSD, so the flash cells don't wear out and fail in some places even though the rest is healthy
2015-05-21 11:58:29	+negen	oh i doubt they have any of that 
2015-05-21 11:58:56	+negen	but there is no writing only reading so they last about 5 or ten years before needing replaced 
2015-05-21 11:59:00	peetaur2	trim/discard declares the space free, available for wear leveling use; also some media probaly automatically moves things around even when you don't trim it
2015-05-21 11:59:16	peetaur2	oh okay, if there's no writing, then no wear leveling needed
2015-05-21 12:00:06	+negen	they are locked by two security chips and can only be read if the two chips can communicate with each other 
2015-05-21 12:01:13	+negen	software would then be read from a second cf card or a hdd 
2015-05-21 12:01:38	+negen	thus keeping the os completely isolated from everything else

2015-05-22 21:11:52	Batch	for sure
2015-05-22 21:11:53	Batch	:)
2015-05-22 21:12:05	Batch	lxqt is goood
2015-05-22 21:12:10	linux_dream	i like arch too.  i am learning more about manjaro, with arch
2015-05-22 21:12:38	linux_dream	looks like manjaro removed netctl and installed NetworkManager
2015-05-22 21:12:44	linux_dream	so I did the same, with arch
2015-05-22 21:13:01	Batch	hehe
2015-05-22 21:13:06	linux_dream	thanks to arch I can notice how much work manjaro has done :)
2015-05-22 21:13:09	Batch	i think
2015-05-22 21:13:33	Batch	manjaro is a distro that optimized arch in it's own way, that's why i love manjaro more then arch
2015-05-22 21:13:36	Batch	made easier
2015-05-22 21:13:45	linux_dream	oh yeah for sure haha
2015-05-22 21:13:57	Batch	i mean for a beginning linux user also
2015-05-22 21:14:11	linux_dream	yes in that sense manjaro is much better
2015-05-22 21:14:28	linux_dream	arch is better if you want to install only what you want /understand
2015-05-22 21:15:15	linux_dream	have you ever tried arch, Batch ?
2015-05-22 21:15:31	Batch	nope xD
2015-05-22 21:15:51	Batch	but i'm sure i don't need to either
2015-05-22 21:15:54	linux_dream	:)
2015-05-22 21:16:07	Batch	manjaro for life hehe
2015-05-22 21:16:09	linux_dream	right, manjaro is enough
2015-05-22 21:16:16	Batch	yeah
2015-05-22 21:16:22	linux_dream	I tried arch to learn a lil' bit more linux
2015-05-22 21:16:25	Batch	i installed freebsd on older laptop
2015-05-22 21:16:48	linux_dream	sounds scary :)
2015-05-22 21:16:50	Batch	and i'm learning about networks etc
2015-05-22 21:16:53	Batch	yeah it is
2015-05-22 21:16:56	linux_dream	not even linux :D
2015-05-22 21:16:58	Batch	but it runs
2015-05-22 21:17:02	linux_dream	nice
2015-05-22 21:17:04	Batch	without dm
2015-05-22 21:17:20	Batch	only use startx and openbox
2015-05-22 21:17:27	Batch	untill now hehe
2015-05-22 21:17:46	Batch	but it's fun man serious
2015-05-22 21:17:59	Batch	someone said try bsd for serverbase
2015-05-22 21:18:01	Batch	i said ok
2015-05-22 21:18:05	linux_dream	haha nice
2015-05-22 21:18:11	Batch	gonna take a lifetime untill that's a server lol
2015-05-22 21:18:21	linux_dream	:)
2015-05-22 21:18:34	linux_dream	startx + openbox,  this must boot fast
2015-05-22 21:18:54	Batch	well it works ok with 719 mb ram
2015-05-22 21:19:03	linux_dream	my first manjaro version was openbox version when it was still officially maintained
2015-05-22 21:19:08	Batch	and intel celeron m
2015-05-22 21:19:20	linux_dream	oh well I am under intel celeron now

2015-05-22 21:20:03	linux_dream	not too slow, but not fast either
2015-05-22 21:20:03	Batch	a laptop that came with 254 mb
2015-05-22 21:20:10	linux_dream	I see
2015-05-22 21:20:14	linux_dream	yeah that's very few
2015-05-22 21:20:34	Batch	and it has no pae
2015-05-22 21:20:34	linux_dream	when I ran arch in live usb, with command line only, it eats 54 Mb of ram
2015-05-22 21:20:51	Batch	right indeed
2015-05-22 21:21:23	Batch	but i think when netinstall manjaro it's almost same ram usage
2015-05-22 21:21:25	Batch	so again
2015-05-22 21:21:29	Batch	manjaro over arch :)
2015-05-22 21:21:48	linux_dream	haha
2015-05-22 21:21:59	linux_dream	yeah auto detecting hardware is really nice
2015-05-22 21:22:24	linux_dream	that's a diff between arch and netinstall manjaro i think
2015-05-22 21:22:32	Batch	in some ways yeah
2015-05-22 21:24:28	Zenther	way more than that
2015-05-22 21:24:52	linux_dream	ah
2015-05-22 21:24:55	Zenther	arch does not include yaourt, base-devel, networkmanager, pulse, and on and on
2015-05-22 21:25:12	linux_dream	I see
2015-05-22 21:25:18	Zenther	arch only has base
2015-05-22 21:25:23	linux_dream	pulse is audio system?
2015-05-22 21:25:27	Zenther	and not one thing more
2015-05-22 21:25:37	Zenther	yes
2015-05-22 21:25:44	linux_dream	ah ok. i installed the base-devel when still in the tty1
2015-05-22 21:25:54	linux_dream	and networkmanager yseterday
2015-05-22 21:26:04	linux_dream	i completly forgot pulse or sound stuff
2015-05-22 21:26:12	linux_dream	so thanks for the tip :)
2015-05-22 21:26:38	linux_dream	I'll try to build packages from the AUR by hand or with own scripts
2015-05-22 21:26:42	linux_dream	and avoid yaourt
2015-05-22 21:27:01	linux_dream	at least temporarily, just for the fun of it
2015-05-22 21:27:11	Zenther	just get the pkgbuild, cd to in, type makepkg -i

2015-05-22 21:31:57	linux_dream	oh man i guess i need those fonts
2015-05-22 21:31:58	Zenther	after installing yaourt
2015-05-22 21:32:09	linux_dream	I had font problems and still have a little bit
2015-05-22 21:32:12	linux_dream	they are so small
2015-05-22 21:32:26	Zenther	some packages that are official in manjaro are in aur in arch
2015-05-22 21:32:46	linux_dream	yeah that's really nice.  i knew dropbox was like this, temporarily
2015-05-22 21:32:57	Zenther	no need for dropbox
2015-05-22 21:33:08	linux_dream	really??
2015-05-22 21:33:19	linux_dream	that's how I sync files from computers
2015-05-22 21:33:25	hardlin3r	hey guys, manjaro is very cool distro
2015-05-22 21:33:28	Batch	proftpd 
2015-05-22 21:33:29	Batch	:p
2015-05-22 21:33:37	Zenther	just grab the txt file and save it on arch box, enter the first comman after cd-ing into directory where it is
2015-05-22 21:34:28	Zenther	it will read the file list and pump it into pacman, download and install if it isn't there already, if it is then it skips to next
2015-05-22 21:35:00	linux_dream	yeah i understand but i'd rather install only the packages that look interesting
2015-05-22 21:35:10	Asterisk	OwnCloud is an excellent Dropbox replacment.
2015-05-22 21:35:44	linux_dream	like the fonts, I'm definitely going to install them all
2015-05-22 21:35:47	Zenther	once you get to a state you think is 'perfect' for you, pacman -Qqen > pkglist.txt
2015-05-22 21:36:03	linux_dream	let me save that command Zenther
2015-05-22 21:36:08	Zenther	then you have your own list of packages to use in those two commands
2015-05-22 21:36:28	linux_dream	that's not perfect of course because I had to blacklist kernel modules and this won't be included in the file, but at least that's nice for a new start
2015-05-22 21:36:39	Zenther	easy to rebuild it, keep the file on a pen drive, dropbox etc
2015-05-22 21:37:03	Zenther	you can also remove packages that are not in the file... pacman -Rsu $(comm -23 <(pacman -Qq|sort) <(sort pkglist))
2015-05-22 21:37:51	Batch	manjaroroot
2015-05-22 21:38:10	linux_dream	that's very useful Zenther.  are those commands called regex?
2015-05-22 21:38:11	Batch	fuck
2015-05-22 21:38:44	Zenther	they are listed on arch's pacman tips wiki page
2015-05-22 21:38:52	linux_dream	oh nice
2015-05-22 21:40:19	Zenther	can think of it in a way as doing a 'restore point' like windows for what packages/programs you have
2015-05-22 21:40:40	linux_dream	yeah I get it.  I never thought about doing something like this
2015-05-22 21:40:59	linux_dream	ok i've installed all the fonts that comes with manjaro net
2015-05-22 21:41:14	Zenther	like I described earlier, you could pump manjaro's package list into pacman/yaourt too
2015-05-22 21:41:34	linux_dream	yeah but many packages, I've no idea what they are, I'd not install them
2015-05-22 21:42:23	Zenther	does not give config's modified by devs, files put in /etc/skel that are modified to tell it what fonts/themes/icons to use etc, but puts the packages there
2015-05-22 21:42:52	Zenther	there ... meaning installed, not in /etc/skel

2015-05-23 17:39:40	manots	naturally ill copy and paste what i (sorry) didnt know how to respond to
2015-05-23 17:39:49	AndrewEMT	Maybe this will be easier... If I reinstall Manjaro and its a fresh install, and do it in non-free mode, will it use the nvidia drivers instead of the open source ones
2015-05-23 17:40:00	+ringo32	AndrewEMT,  nah wait
2015-05-23 17:40:01	manots	<manjaro-kde5> Good afternoon, I am new to Manjaro and am wondering if someone can walk me through how to use bumblebee with the proprietary drivers? Currently it is set to use the open source ones.
2015-05-23 17:40:10	+ringo32	AndrewEMT,  what kinda videocard
2015-05-23 17:40:18	AndrewEMT	NVidia 860M
2015-05-23 17:40:26	AndrewEMT	and intel haswell chip
2015-05-23 17:40:39	+ringo32	which issue did you had ? hastebin.com  , mhwd -li
2015-05-23 17:41:31	AndrewEMT	I'm actually just wanting to use the actual NVidia drivers and not the nouveau ones. I tried mwhd but it says it cannot install the proprietary ones because it conflicts with the open source ones
2015-05-23 17:41:53	thid	superbia as "new" u mean ur not "used" or u try to make as belive that u are forever young?
2015-05-23 17:41:55	xTomyLEE	so remove open source and install nvidia
2015-05-23 17:41:55	AndrewEMT	So just want to switch to the proprietary ones is all
2015-05-23 17:42:11	+ringo32	you must first remove the opensource part only need explaination
2015-05-23 17:42:16	+ringo32	reinstal you can lways do
2015-05-23 17:42:26	superbia	thid: i am marvelous and shiny
2015-05-23 17:42:44	thid	superbia: lol
2015-05-23 17:42:53	AndrewEMT	Yes, but if I reinstall as I just installed this, and do it in "non-free" I take it the propretary drivers will be in place instead of the nouveau ones right?

2015-05-23 17:46:10	AndrewEMT	And if I use the non-free option off the LiveCD... Will it install the NVidia drivers and not the open source ones?

2015-05-24 16:50:23	+Strit_Laptop	coolthingy500, ofcourse you can.
2015-05-24 16:50:34	+Strit_Laptop	if you have grub installed that is.
2015-05-24 16:51:00	coolthingy500	I can't do that with Arch because there is a different command set up for that.
2015-05-24 16:51:17	dasdieder	when i run os-prober it detects all my OS correctly but when i reboot manjaro is still shown as an older install and when i try to boot it its not possible
2015-05-24 16:51:46	+Strit_Laptop	dasdieder, that's because you need to use "sudo update-grub" to update the boot menu.

2015-05-24 18:53:21	Spec-Chum	Manjaro live loads and works fine, I then install to this SSD and it installs fine, I then reboot and the login screen works fine, I then log in and it's fine, I then use the system for about 20 seconds and bang, drive disappears and every command in terminal gives me an IO error
2015-05-24 18:53:22	linux_dream	i hope your new kernel will work Spec-Chum 
2015-05-24 18:53:57	linux_dream	uefi with gtp partition?
2015-05-24 18:54:12	linux_dream	since you dual boot with windows
2015-05-24 18:54:21	Spec-Chum	linux_dream, it is now but I started with an MBR.  I converted it to see if that would fix it
2015-05-24 18:54:30	linux_dream	ok
2015-05-24 18:54:32	Spec-Chum	also tried to install on both BIOS and UEFI modes
2015-05-24 18:55:11	linux_dream	I find really puzzling the fact that the live cd works fine but not the ssd
2015-05-24 18:55:26	linux_dream	looks like the ssd is the problem somehow
2015-05-24 18:55:38	Spec-Chum	what gets me though is why the drive is still gone after a reset, only a power down fixes it
2015-05-24 18:56:11	linux_dream	post your problem in the forum, just in case a dev sees it...
2015-05-24 18:56:33	Spec-Chum	ringo32, is now aware lol
2015-05-24 18:56:54	Spec-Chum	I wonder if there's anything in the madm code that turns off a drive?
2015-05-24 18:57:09	Spec-Chum	I still can't help thinking that my RAID0 array is causing this

2015-05-24 18:59:18	Spec-Chum	I've still got manjaro in vm

2015-05-24 19:00:14	+ringo32	ive got no ssd :/
2015-05-24 19:00:34	linux_dream	0.8.11 is kernel 3.14 or 3.16  i think
2015-05-24 19:00:39	Spec-Chum	it's quite clear that manjaro are doing something different, just not sure what
2015-05-24 19:00:50	linux_dream	yeah
2015-05-24 19:00:53	Spec-Chum	s/manjaro/manjaro and Ubuntu
2015-05-24 19:01:05	linux_dream	ringo32, is it possible to transform arch into manjaro?
2015-05-24 19:01:27	+ringo32	theoretical is always possible but make it work? i dont think so
2015-05-24 19:01:44	+ringo32	its always possible i think there was some written on it
2015-05-24 19:02:05	linux_dream	i know passing from manjaro to arch is/was possible but the other way around i don't know
2015-05-24 19:02:05	Spec-Chum	actually, ringo32, the manjaro GUI installed says it doesn't handle raid too well, do you know the issue?
2015-05-24 19:02:17	Spec-Chum	I'm not installing to raid but I do have an array
2015-05-24 19:02:57	linux_dream	Spec-Chum, on the forum there is FadeMan, i think he's the guy who could have the answer to your problem

2015-05-24 21:30:53	CountryfiedLinux	Spec-Chum, Or even a better idea I just thought of is backing it up to cloud storage. Can't guarantee the USB stick will last for years.
2015-05-24 21:31:58	Spec-Chum	CountryfiedLinux, to be honest it makes no difference as the key is now usually embedded in the BIOS, so you can just use any Windows disc/ISO
2015-05-24 21:32:24	Spec-Chum	I reinstalled Windows 8.1 on my laptop from an ISO created from this desktop
2015-05-24 21:32:58	Spec-Chum	I only backed up in case I have to send the laptop back for whatever reason so it'll have all their crappy software on it
2015-05-24 21:33:00	thenewone	great 
2015-05-24 21:33:01	Batch	CountryfiedLinux, you know about mediacreation tool?
2015-05-24 21:33:26	CountryfiedLinux	I don't Batch 
2015-05-24 21:33:31	Batch	h/o
2015-05-24 21:33:51	Batch	http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media
2015-05-24 21:34:03	Batch	first time could fail CountryfiedLinux 
2015-05-24 21:34:13	Batch	second time will work
2015-05-24 21:34:42	Batch	i think it's always good to have
2015-05-24 21:35:29	CountryfiedLinux	I used the recovery software to USB from Gateway and it failed.
2015-05-24 21:35:43	Batch	this one works man
2015-05-24 21:35:52	CountryfiedLinux	I then called Gateway and explained and the "best they could do" is sell me a recovery DVD.
2015-05-24 21:35:57	Batch	haha
2015-05-24 21:36:00	CountryfiedLinux	So I went around them and got it installed anyways.
2015-05-24 21:36:01	Batch	no
2015-05-24 21:36:02	Batch	don't
2015-05-24 21:36:07	CountryfiedLinux	Don't ask me how :P

2015-05-24 21:36:43	Spec-Chum	I tried that on a VM last week
2015-05-24 21:36:54	Spec-Chum	seemed nice even if the new browser kept crashing
2015-05-24 21:36:59	Batch	like every other linux user now i started to dislike windows
2015-05-24 21:37:03	Spec-Chum	that could be a virtualbox issue tho
2015-05-24 21:37:08	Batch	windows 10 will be last windows edition ever
2015-05-24 21:37:24	Batch	don't know about there future

2015-05-24 21:38:12	CountryfiedLinux	I'm on Windows now because it's the best option for a video content creator like me.
2015-05-24 21:38:24	Batch	right
2015-05-24 21:38:31	CountryfiedLinux	Yes, I paid $40 for video editing software but it comes with a lifetime of updates.
2015-05-24 21:38:55	CountryfiedLinux	I'm open-minded when it comes to OSes.
2015-05-24 21:38:58	Batch	i stopped paying
2015-05-24 21:39:05	Batch	yeah
2015-05-24 21:39:16	Batch	every person has it own flavors
2015-05-24 21:39:16	CountryfiedLinux	I don't trust pirated software nor do I feel morally right about it.
2015-05-24 21:39:26	thenewone	i was paying for stuff on games 
2015-05-24 21:39:47	thenewone	about softs never :)

2015-05-24 21:40:33	CountryfiedLinux	Yes Stuzz I much prefer Wondershare Filmora.
2015-05-24 21:40:46	CountryfiedLinux	No Batch that sucks and is no longer supported.

2015-05-24 21:41:13	Batch	did it come with installed windows?
2015-05-24 21:41:19	CountryfiedLinux	I have my spare HDD I install stuff on all the time.

2015-05-24 22:33:01	Zenther-	tint2 sucks as a panel
2015-05-24 22:33:19	Zenther-	might as well be a conky window
2015-05-24 22:33:28	stevelitt	In that case, use LXDE or LXQt, and get Openbox with a full panel and lots of little apps!
2015-05-24 22:33:58	Zenther-	better
2015-05-24 22:34:14	Zenther-	I'll stick to cinnamon

2015-05-25 12:37:19	linux_dream	at least you compiled the kernel and DE within 3 days
2015-05-25 12:37:31	linux_dream	I have a low spec laptop too
2015-05-25 12:37:40	Zenther	kernel only takes maybe 20-30 mins
2015-05-25 12:37:45	linux_dream	I went for Arch because I thought I-d need an 8 cores desktop computer for gentoo

2015-05-25 12:37:51	MetzKetz	yea, i'm surprised. have 10 year old laptop here. and even with bare minimum lxde it was not even near that fast
2015-05-25 12:37:53	linux_dream	oh man awesome
2015-05-25 12:38:13	Zenther	what takes time compiling is things like qtwebkit, webkit-gtk or a browser
2015-05-25 12:38:57	Zenther	libwebkit-gtk I think took me 4-6 hours alone

2015-05-25 14:29:35	Zenther	anyone use owncloud? is it any good?
2015-05-25 14:30:15	+Strit_Laptop	its alright for a free alternative to dropbox.
2015-05-25 14:30:31	Zenther	hell, it's in community!
2015-05-25 14:30:36	+Strit_Laptop	yep
2015-05-25 14:31:25	Zenther	owncloud, and 6 apps - bookmarks, calendar, contacts, documents, gallery
2015-05-25 14:31:34	CountryfiedLinux	I saw a Youtube video of a power lifter suggesting reps to slowdown instead of reps to failure.
2015-05-25 14:32:05	CountryfiedLinux	Basically saying when you start slowing down that's the time to re-rack it or take some weight off until you can reach set reps before slowdown.
2015-05-25 14:32:36	CountryfiedLinux	But I think that's more of a power lifter strategy than a bodybuilder. I'm a hybrid between the 2.
2015-05-25 14:32:51	CountryfiedLinux	Some weeks I rep heavy some not so much.

We take security passionately and therefore make sure your data is safely stored. We are based in Oslo, Norway and data stored on our infrastructure is subject to EU data protection laws and rights. Our user's data is not under the jurisdiction of Patriot Act.
2015-05-25 14:39:52	Zenther	don't know what the laws are... they leave some statements out actually
2015-05-25 14:40:11	linux_dream	probably not safe
2015-05-25 14:40:19	Zenther	they do not explicitly state the data is stored in an encrypted state
2015-05-25 14:40:28	linux_dream	proton email has servers based in switzerland to escape EU laws
2015-05-25 14:40:47	linux_dream	and as such I am guessing it is safe
2015-05-25 14:41:19	Zenther	it could be that when transfered it is communicated encrypted
2015-05-25 14:41:36	Zenther	and stored safely (in a locked server room) lol
2015-05-25 14:41:38	linux_dream	the problem is that under EU laws the government can sneak into it
2015-05-25 14:42:09	Zenther	I am less worried about the govt than hackers
2015-05-25 14:42:21	linux_dream	ok then I guess it-s safe
2015-05-25 14:42:26	Zenther	for example, storing sensitive things like tax return filings in the cloud
2015-05-25 14:42:39	linux_dream	I see
2015-05-25 14:43:14	Zenther	I use dropbox but have an encrypted folder that is mounted locally
2015-05-25 14:43:55	linux_dream	I also use dropbox, but without any encryption... so far
2015-05-25 14:44:02	Zenther	I do the encryption... but on logging in I have a popup that asks for the password to mount the encrypted folder

2015-05-25 15:44:36	linux_dream	big, cheap and low quality :)
2015-05-25 15:44:49	+Esclapion	a lot bigger. See the pric of a 1TB SSD
2015-05-25 15:44:52	Spec-Chum	linux_dream, yeah it's fast, at least twice as fast as the fastest mechanical drive
2015-05-25 15:44:55	Spec-Chum	not bad for USB :)
2015-05-25 15:45:01	+ringo32	i think to buy a new hdd with a dock to use my older hdd for testing ,?
2015-05-25 15:45:02	linux_dream	yeah the price is the problem but other than this....
2015-05-25 15:45:26	linux_dream	if I lived in Europe or north America I wouldn't bother with hdd
2015-05-25 15:45:47	linux_dream	it's like buying an old CRT monitor to me

2015-05-25 19:11:51	mrappie	Nice I know what you mean
2015-05-25 19:11:51	MetzKetz	there is no "better". there is only 'different'
2015-05-25 19:11:53	thenewone1	arch made only for experts if i can say that 
2015-05-25 19:12:02	mrappie	that is the same reason for me to try something new
2015-05-25 19:12:02	thenewone1	manjaro for both 
2015-05-25 19:12:19	thenewone1	you can try netmanjar 
2015-05-25 19:12:22	thenewone1	netmanjaro

2015-05-25 19:13:35	thenewone1	and that happen rare
2015-05-25 19:13:40	thenewone1	but in manjaro the update huge

2015-05-26 11:54:04	+ringo32	you must add slimlock in slock
2015-05-26 11:54:30	+ringo32	make a script in /usr/bin/slock
2015-05-26 11:54:36	Arbite	i dont have slock

2015-05-26 12:23:00	thenewone	are you on manjaro ?
2015-05-26 12:23:07	Arbite	or the GUI?
2015-05-26 12:23:18	Zenther	thenewone, it all makes a difference what de environment you use
2015-05-26 12:23:19	thenewone	any one white graphical interface 
2015-05-26 12:23:21	thenewone	easy to use

2015-05-26 12:24:26	peetaur2	most likely nearly everyone in #manjaro runs manjaro I suspect
2015-05-26 12:24:44	thenewone	ok peetaur2 when you clic on Win+p 
2015-05-26 12:24:48	thenewone	it's show you a windows 
2015-05-26 12:24:54	thenewone	what the name of that program plz
2015-05-26 12:24:54	Zenther	Server = ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/$repo/os/$arch
2015-05-26 12:24:59	peetaur2	you have to tell us which DE it is or we won't know which GUI program will do what you want (change video resolution?)
2015-05-26 12:25:10	sky2	is that due to processor's poor performance ?
2015-05-26 12:25:14	peetaur2	for example XFCE
2015-05-26 12:25:18	Zenther	that line in pacman.conf sepecifically tells it too look at what architecture you are using
2015-05-26 12:25:37	thenewone	peetaur2: xfce4
2015-05-26 12:25:42	Zenther	the $arch == the one you are using/on
2015-05-26 12:25:44	+Strit_Laptop	Zenther, thought so. Just hoped the server query could see files from other architectures aswell.
2015-05-26 12:25:57	peetaur2	okay now someone hopefully can answer that... but not me since I never used XFCE
2015-05-26 12:25:59	Zenther	no, you have to browse the server
2015-05-26 12:26:14	sky2	:(
2015-05-26 12:26:30	thenewone	guys who run manjaro-xfce4 ?
2015-05-26 12:26:38	+Strit_Laptop	Zenther, dang. Trying to query it from a machine with other architecture then.
2015-05-26 12:26:49	Zenther	thenewone, xfce has a settings application in the menu
2015-05-26 12:27:00	sky2	or need more RAM to run x264.mkv files ?
2015-05-26 12:27:16	sky2	now it has 1.5GB RAM

2015-05-26 12:28:16	Zenther	thenewone, you said xfce! so now you are back on the ignore list
2015-05-26 12:28:36	peetaur2	sky2: if you run "free -m" while you are playing video and there is some free, then don't blame low RAM. But 1.5 is not much these days.
2015-05-26 12:28:37	thenewone	Zenther: i want that programe
2015-05-26 12:28:54	thenewone	who care if that xfce4 or other wm 
2015-05-26 12:28:59	thenewone	just the program 
2015-05-26 12:29:07	thenewone	why guys you make it complicated 
2015-05-26 12:29:27	thenewone	i want the program because i found it easy when i was using manajaro-xfce4 i cant remember then name of it 
2015-05-26 12:29:36	thenewone	thats it
2015-05-26 12:29:57	sky2	peetaur2, sorry did not get u "free -m" !
2015-05-26 12:30:00	peetaur2	because every DE comes with a different program that doesn't work with the rest of the DEs ... you are the one that made it complicated
2015-05-26 12:30:09	sky2	i was only playing the video 
2015-05-26 12:30:16	peetaur2	sky2: a command to run on command line that tells you about memory usage

2015-05-26 23:36:44	linux_dream	not compiling and have more than 900 packages
2015-05-26 23:36:55	linux_dream	so your laptop keeps up with being up to date
2015-05-26 23:37:00	linux_dream	it's 1 update per week?
2015-05-26 23:37:12	Zenther-	rolling release like arch
2015-05-26 23:37:17	linux_dream	ah..
2015-05-26 23:37:20	ediT	yo 
2015-05-26 23:37:21	Zenther-	but, they have a stable and a testing repo
2015-05-26 23:37:35	Zenther-	packages get 'locked' for a while on stable
2015-05-26 23:37:35	linux_dream	and it's 100% free software stuff?
2015-05-26 23:37:52	Zenther-	might go thru 3-5 chrome updates before new one goes to stable
2015-05-26 23:38:03	linux_dream	I see
2015-05-26 23:38:10	Zenther-	they just keep patching it in stable instead of updating constantly
2015-05-26 23:38:17	linux_dream	so sticking on stable means less updates right?
2015-05-26 23:38:27	Zenther-	not really

2015-05-26 23:39:33	linux_dream	well I'll think about installing Gentoo, I'm really tempted

2015-05-26 23:40:03	Zenther-	lol
2015-05-26 23:40:14	ediT	i would but i'm just not a fan of emerge
2015-05-26 23:40:18	linux_dream	and the stupid question that people must ask tons of times.... do you notice any difference in the speed of your hardware under gentoo vs other distros?
2015-05-26 23:40:25	Zenther-	oh, and I am using systemd, screw that gentoo openrc crap
2015-05-26 23:40:31	linux_dream	oh really

2015-05-26 23:41:17	linux_dream	well he's doing well and under a laptop
2015-05-26 23:41:18	Zenther-	linux_dream, you can set the make.conf file to compile using just your specific processor instead of a generic one, so it can be faster
2015-05-26 23:41:33	day|flip	linux_dream: if your temped to used gentoo. give funtoo a try. it little bit easier to install
2015-05-26 23:41:34	linux_dream	that's basically the reason why I'd use gentoo Zenther
2015-05-26 23:41:55	linux_dream	I don't like easy stuff day|flip.  I am under Arch right now, since about 1 week so far
2015-05-26 23:42:10	day|flip	linux_dream: the only con with funtoo is that their pure openrc
2015-05-26 23:42:10	Zenther-	plus, you use use= flags when compiling to tell it what parts of the program to include or not which results in file size, load time, response time, etc
2015-05-26 23:42:13	linux_dream	the harder it is, the better
2015-05-26 23:42:44	linux_dream	yeah I've heard that you can compile a kernel just made for your pc
2015-05-26 23:42:49	linux_dream	that sounds awesome
2015-05-26 23:43:07	day|flip	linux_dream: i'm not using a easy distro. they don't hold your hands to much. but they help if something you cant figure out
2015-05-26 23:43:23	linux_dream	true day|flip

2015-05-26 23:47:44	linux_dream	and you built a special kernel that fits your hardware Zenther?  like no  bluetooth related stuff if your hardware doesn't support it

2015-05-29 19:40:21	Zenther	there is a lot of info to be gained just from metadata of files
2015-05-29 19:40:24	thid|afk	since arm cpus in smartphone dont support ecrypting native everything is handled live by cpu :D battery kill

2015-05-29 19:41:06	linux_dream	Zenther I'm confused already on data vs disk encryption.  In my case which one is it?  Can't be disk encryption because the definition involves "OS" but in my case I won't have any OS installed.  so it's data?

2015-05-29 19:42:00	Zenther	if you are using the new hard drive just for data, then you will be using data encryption, if you are putting the os on it in an encrypted state, then it is system encrytion

2015-05-29 19:42:58	Zenther	right
2015-05-29 19:43:36	thid|afk	Zenther: afair with system encryption it was almost impossible to restore data from failing HDD or that I mess something and it was about disk ecryption
2015-05-29 19:44:03	Zenther	it is still easy to reset root password in linux, to keep files from being messed with, then you would need system encryption... keeps the cops from simply resetting root password and gaining access to do what they want

2015-05-29 19:44:57	thenewone	cool linux_dream 
2015-05-29 19:45:03	Zenther	thid|afk, system encryption has to be locked/unlocked at boot and only time it can be done
2015-05-29 19:45:12	linux_dream	i don't need an onion layers of securities
2015-05-29 19:45:15	Zenther	so, if you cannot do it there, you cannot get to it

2015-05-29 19:52:40	Zenther	Jolt2bolt, resetting root pw as easy and hitting e in grub, adding single to boot line, booting, and passwd at prompt, you are already root and no password is entered... told you it was easy

2015-05-30 12:36:50	Arbite	=)
2015-05-30 12:39:36	Arbite	i must hand it to you, I have been a linux user on and off with bsd and windows for 15 years now, But i never got stuck, always alot of things that i freakin hated, that didnt work, that should work out of the box, strange issues ETC ETC,,, But manjaro baby, Hello Jesus, OMG 
2015-05-30 12:40:37	Arbite	best thing that has happened to the linux world
2015-05-30 12:42:08	Spec-Chum	2nd best

2015-05-30 12:42:52	Zenther	I just wished upstream apps would adopt more of the spit and polish that ubuntu devs have added in patches and such to apps
2015-05-30 12:42:54	Spec-Chum	poke
2015-05-30 12:43:31	youri	octopi: "You'll need to install a su frontend like gksu or kdesu"
2015-05-30 12:43:40	youri	But I have kdesu
2015-05-30 12:43:45	Spec-Chum	I do like ubuntu patches
2015-05-30 12:43:59	Spec-Chum	even simple ones like transpaency in gnome terminal
2015-05-30 12:44:09	Spec-Chum	saying that, fedora do that too
2015-05-30 12:44:14	+Strit_Laptop	youri, you sure? try running "sudo pacman -S kdesu"
2015-05-30 12:44:15	Arbite	booyaa
2015-05-30 12:44:15	Spec-Chum	and that's in the AUR
2015-05-30 12:44:27	Zenther	there is a difference between kdesudo and another, forgeet the name, one is for kde4 and one for kde5 for the lack of a better name
2015-05-30 12:44:48	youri	Yes, just did that before restarting octopi, and it even shows as installed in octopi too
2015-05-30 12:44:53	Spec-Chum	there's no need for *su now, just use sudo even with a gui app

2015-05-30 16:36:02	thevaliantx	i am thinking about installing Manjaro.  I am ONLY a beginner.  For awhile we have been using Mint 17 but were disappointed with not being able to get JPG's on a network harddrive to show up in the file manager, and to get the OfficeJet 6500 printer to work through the network.  
2015-05-30 16:36:06	@ringo32	even i use cinnamon now :)
2015-05-30 16:36:21	thevaliantx	It appears those issues, for us anyway, are resolved with Manjaro.  :)
2015-05-30 16:36:43	alekzanther	thevaliantx: kde has good built in support for handling those kind of files
2015-05-30 16:37:18	alekzanther	are you trying it out on xfce or kde btw?
2015-05-30 16:37:36	thevaliantx	I know nothing about 'pacman', and a stupid part of me wonders if it is around to stay, since for the longest time I would use 'apt-get'.  I will never be an expert in Linux, just simply not smart enough (I'm an artist in the making).
2015-05-30 16:37:53	thevaliantx	XFCE ... 
2015-05-30 16:38:22	alekzanther	pacman, apt-get, 
2015-05-30 16:38:30	+Strit_Laptop	thevaliantx, pacman is gonna be around just as long as apt-get
2015-05-30 16:38:34	alekzanther	yum etc are all the same with a different engine beneath
2015-05-30 16:38:35	thevaliantx	i am not liking the fonts (especially in the browser) during the live session, but I saw a tutorial posted in the forums on how to get the Ubuntu fonts working.
2015-05-30 16:38:46	+Strit_Laptop	thevaliantx, because they do the same job, just for different distros.
2015-05-30 16:38:53	alekzanther	yeah
2015-05-30 16:39:26	alekzanther	pacman is here to stay and probably grow since the interest in arch is growing like crazy
2015-05-30 16:39:51	thevaliantx	Okay.  It just seems a different version of Linux comes along every day, excting to try out for newbies.
2015-05-30 16:39:53	alekzanther	it has a better dependency and requirements solution than apt-get as well
2015-05-30 16:40:18	thevaliantx	i did have the Arch Linux iso burnd, but felt that I would just not be able to do anything with it with my knowledge so limited.

2015-05-30 16:41:32	thevaliantx	one of the things that i would like to do is have Manjaro update on its own, such as when a new version comes out, and perhaps try again at learning programming.  
2015-05-30 16:41:37	alekzanther	in my honest opinion, manjaro is the sweet spot between bleeding edge and ubuntu-releases... hard to explain but you get frequent updates, you are able to change kernels on the fly, and you are not having a system that chrashes/break suddenly
2015-05-30 16:42:16	Manj-811-Xfce2	Which do you recommend xfce?_ kde?

2015-05-30 17:35:23	Spec-Chum	thevaliantx, for one thing most distros have python 2 and 3
2015-05-30 17:35:54	thid	I would stick to 2
2015-05-30 17:36:10	Spec-Chum	thevaliantx, and don't forget we're taking about linux here, there are no exe files
2015-05-30 17:36:10	thid	python 2 still have more modules then python 3
2015-05-30 17:36:23	thevaliantx	okay.  
2015-05-30 17:36:35	Spec-Chum	thid I would have agreed with you last year but most distros are 3 by default now
2015-05-30 17:36:45	Spec-Chum	type 'python' and see
2015-05-30 17:36:53	thevaliantx	nice community here.  i know, it's just Saturday, things could be gloomy around here on Monday, but i enjoyed the chat.

2015-05-30 17:37:56	thid	Spec-Chum: I know still I stick to python2. Like whats the point of using python3 and django if u cant use some librarys u need. And porting them from 2 to 3 is waste of time
2015-05-30 17:38:31	thid	also even manjaro have still python2 in repo
2015-05-30 17:38:33	Spec-Chum	thid, but we're talking about someone learning it new, I'd stick to 3 if you don't know 2 already
2015-05-30 17:38:36	Spec-Chum	but I get your point
2015-05-30 17:38:55	Spec-Chum	thid, it'll be installed, not just in the repo

2015-05-31 18:57:37	Spec-Chum	RageSith, that's a common scenario
2015-05-31 18:57:39	RageSith	i hated it when i was trying to start node-webkit app for instance and it says versions mismatch of lib since they didnt had the newest one :P
2015-05-31 18:58:15	RageSith	and the aur is great too, saved me so much time
2015-05-31 18:58:26	RageSith	but maybe i can ask another stupid question...
2015-05-31 18:58:37	Spec-Chum	RageSith, never stopped you before
2015-05-31 18:59:03	RageSith	the diffrence between arch and manjaro is that manjaro hold back the new update for a lil till its save to update (i think i read something about it)
2015-05-31 18:59:03	Spec-Chum	(you'll get used to me, I mean nothing by it hah)
2015-05-31 18:59:42	[thor]	manjaro also comes with tools to ease installation as well as coming with a small suite of pre-installed packages.
2015-05-31 18:59:48	Spec-Chum	RageSith, that's not far off, but manjaro has 3 repos, stable, testing and unstable
2015-05-31 18:59:57	Spec-Chum	unstable is only a day or 2 behind arch

2015-05-31 19:44:21	Spec-Chum	adsmz, sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt
2015-05-31 19:44:28	adsmz	ok
2015-05-31 19:44:31	Spec-Chum	change X to wherever the real install is
2015-05-31 19:45:22	adsmz	ok, mounted sda and it says it's write-protected
2015-05-31 19:45:37	Spec-Chum	it'll be sda1 I think
2015-05-31 19:45:58	Manj-811-Xfce2	which is better? chrome chromium or firefox on manjaro?

2015-05-31 19:47:11	adsmz	Manj-811-Xfce2: it depends on what you need. chrome has the best flash support, chromium is basically Free chrome (I think it doesn't have the same flash thing though), and firefox is apparently adding targeted ads
2015-05-31 19:47:48	adsmz	it says -d is an invalid option

2015-05-31 19:48:08	+ringo32	google-chrome is the nonfree chromium :)

2015-06-03 00:29:14	linux_dream	so if there's an error when building the package I'll know what happened now that it's in the terminal...
2015-06-03 00:29:42	Zenther-	it would connect fine for about 8 pings then destination unreachable and telling networkmanager to disconnect/reconnect on box would suddenly ping another 8 times then destination unreachable...
2015-06-03 00:30:30	linux_dream	ouch
2015-06-03 00:30:43	linux_dream	no idea what dd-wrt is

2015-06-03 00:31:26	ediT	"wrt"... very nice
2015-06-03 00:31:29	Zenther-	you can flash it onto many routers
2015-06-03 00:31:31	linux_dream	I see
2015-06-03 00:32:02	Zenther-	since it is running linux, you can add many features that your router's software did not hav

2015-06-03 00:32:30	linux_dream	like an ad blocker?

2015-06-03 01:27:55	Pabc1	I was just wondering. What init system does Manjaro use? Systemd? :o
2015-06-03 01:28:11	reborn	okay
2015-06-03 01:28:19	Zenther	yes, systemd is standard
2015-06-03 01:28:20	coolthingy500	systemd
2015-06-03 01:28:35	coolthingy500	That's a common inti for most distros.
2015-06-03 01:28:39	coolthingy500	init
2015-06-03 01:29:00	coolthingy500	Manjaro does have a openRC edition
2015-06-03 01:30:31	Zenther	there is a community edition that has openrc
2015-06-03 01:30:32	Zenther	reborn, that cups error: success is a known bug upstream accross multiple distros
2015-06-03 01:30:51	Pabc1	Is there an advantage on using one or the other?
2015-06-03 01:30:53	Zenther	There is a compatacility issue between gutenprint and the foomatic-db filter files, all you need to do is remove these two packages:
2015-06-03 01:30:53	Zenther	sudo pacman -Rdd foomatic-db foomatic-db-nonfree
2015-06-03 01:31:14	Zenther	This is because gutenprint reads the fomantic db files when it loads if they are present, the problem is that foomatic recieved and update that changed the format of these files, gutenprint has not yet been updated. I'm not even sure if the gutenprint developers are aware of this change.
2015-06-03 01:31:14	reborn	i see.

2015-06-05 00:25:42	gerep	linux_dream, yes, that's really interesting, so it would be like m'gc or something
2015-06-05 00:25:42	arkasizer	linux_dream, not completely true the vowels are placed above and below each letter
2015-06-05 00:25:45	arkasizer	i'll write it foryou

2015-06-06 01:24:15	arkasizer	You need to supply correct root password
2015-06-06 01:24:40	Manj-811-Xfce3	I am doing it using the UI updater, it does not ask me the password
2015-06-06 01:24:44	arkasizer	you can terminal update by typing:  sudo pacman -Syu
2015-06-06 01:24:56	Manj-811-Xfce3	let me try that

2015-06-06 01:25:54	Manj-811-Xfce3	yes
2015-06-06 01:26:08	Manj-811-Xfce3	terminal is fine
2015-06-06 01:26:12	Manj-811-Xfce3	going on atm

2015-06-06 12:47:09	stevelitt	There's a chart of percentage vs freezing temperature.
2015-06-06 12:47:11	Zenther	well, I don't think corsair releases what the mixture ratio is

2015-06-06 13:21:09	thid	lol
2015-06-06 13:21:12	peetaur	so I probably need to rebuild it for my kernel, but don't know how
2015-06-06 13:21:14	thid	it doesnt work that way
2015-06-06 13:21:20	thid	when u set config
2015-06-06 13:21:34	thid	u chose what to build in and what to load as module
2015-06-06 13:21:36	peetaur	help online just says to use the crappy nvidia installer (taht I have tried before and found it to horribly damage the system and fail to uninstall)
2015-06-06 13:21:40	thid	just look at ur module list
2015-06-06 13:22:01	peetaur	you mean in the kernel config? it's not there... nvidia nonfree is not in mainline kernel
2015-06-06 13:22:03	thid	and then remember to set those modules in ur config
2015-06-06 13:22:11	peetaur	so how do I build it for my custom kernel?
2015-06-06 13:23:22	thid	well

2015-06-06 13:23:58	thid	that would be start
2015-06-06 13:24:24	thid	also nvidia-hook in mkinitcpio
2015-06-06 13:24:55	thid	but anyway u need DKMS in ur kernel
2015-06-06 13:25:05	thid	dynamic kernel module support
2015-06-06 13:25:27	thid	check arch wiki, I bet theres solution there for custom kernels

Also, scanimage --format=tiff > test.tiff scans just a small portion, then exits.. (if you want to see the small portion, i can upload it).. Still no dice though, just scans black or doesn't do anything after the first scan on reboot..

2015-06-06 15:20:33	apexbang	so unplugging and repluggin doesn't work, what does work tho, is if i change the permissions of /run/lock/sane after every scan.. so, i guess that's what has to be done..
2015-06-06 15:21:02	superbia1	so change the permission permanentley
2015-06-06 15:21:20	superbia1	if that doesnt work, make a script that changes it every 5 seconds
2015-06-06 15:21:28	apexbang	that's what i have in mind :)

2015-06-06 22:15:57	Zenther	it is all marketing
2015-06-06 22:16:09	Batch	i'll allways have it in my trunk
2015-06-06 22:16:15	Batch	comes handy anytime
2015-06-06 22:17:01	Batch	so many other sprays, but i was always happy with result of wd40
2015-06-06 22:17:10	Zenther	now, PB Blaster is the real shit!
2015-06-06 22:17:31	Zenther	give me a can of PB Blaster before even think of handing me a can of WD40
2015-06-06 22:17:58	Batch	well that gives directly PB blaster vs wd40 in google search lol
2015-06-06 22:18:11	Batch	seems good man
2015-06-06 22:18:35	Batch	it's the opensource version of wd40? xD
2015-06-06 22:18:45	Batch	lol*
2015-06-06 22:18:55	Zenther	mostly if it says "As seen on TV" on it, it is garbage, 2 exceptions, PB Blaster and Awesome cleaner.

2015-06-06 22:38:01	Zenther	does not exist in a systemd environment
2015-06-06 22:38:35	Pabc1	It works on my Xubuntu installation :o and I believe it also uses systemd.
2015-06-06 22:38:45	Zenther	nope
2015-06-06 22:39:05	Zenther	they have their own, going to systemd if I remember correctly
2015-06-06 22:39:55	Pabc1	Oh, that explains it.
2015-06-06 22:40:39	Pabc1	Thanks
2015-06-06 22:40:55	Zenther	xubuntu uses upstart
2015-06-06 22:41:29	Pabc1	Yeah, I thought they had changed it to systemd already. Haha
2015-06-06 22:41:32	Pabc1	I see.
2015-06-06 22:42:07	Zenther	I think the latest has it but not by default
2015-06-06 22:42:14	Pabc1	But, does the concept of "runlevels" still exist on a systemd enviroment?
2015-06-06 22:42:21	Zenther	you have to add the init= line to the kernel line of grub
2015-06-06 22:43:19	Zenther	systemd uses targets which serve a similar purpose as runlevels but act a little different. Each target is named instead of numbered and is intended to serve a specific purpose with the possibility of having multiple ones active at the same time. Some targets are implemented by inheriting all of the services of another target and adding additional services to it. There are systemd targets that mimic the common SystemVinit runlevels so you can 
2015-06-06 22:43:19	Zenther	still switch targets using the familiar telinit RUNLEVEL command.
2015-06-06 22:43:36	Zenther	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd
2015-06-06 22:44:27	Pabc1	So it still uses a similar concept. Well, thanks for your help ^^
2015-06-06 22:44:36	Zenther	well, not really
2015-06-06 22:45:11	Zenther	you can still use the thinking of the same things, but it just fools it into the systemd way
2015-06-06 22:45:23	Zenther	like a bridge from old way to new way
2015-06-06 22:46:02	Zenther	it just mimics the old way

2015-06-06 22:46:43	Pabc1	I see. That makes sense.
2015-06-06 22:46:54	Zenther	in reality, you don't change the runlevel from a prompt to a gui, you start the systemd service file for the gui environment and it does the rest
2015-06-06 22:47:40	Zenther	to stop going to the gui back to boot to prompt, you just disable that service file
2015-06-06 22:47:54	Zenther	sudo systemctl disable lightdm
2015-06-06 22:48:20	Zenther	and no longer go to lightdm desktop manager (x) and end up at a login prompt
2015-06-06 22:49:28	linux_dream	hey Zenther 1 question about gentoo, compared to arch
2015-06-06 22:49:42	Zenther	that would be the same of going to run level 5 or back to 3
2015-06-06 22:49:42	linux_dream	when you install a package through emerge, usually are they up to date compared to Arch?
2015-06-06 22:49:50	Zenther	both would be multi-user
2015-06-06 22:49:50	linux_dream	and is there an equivalent to the AUR?
2015-06-06 22:50:13	Zenther	up to date the same as arch, NO
2015-06-06 22:50:26	Zenther	it is more like a semi-rolling
2015-06-06 22:50:32	linux_dream	like manjaro?
2015-06-06 22:50:46	Zenther	it brings it up to what someone decides is the latest stable release
2015-06-06 22:51:04	Zenther	some apps may be several versions behind
2015-06-06 22:51:12	linux_dream	I see... so usually a few weeks behind arch?
2015-06-06 22:51:18	linux_dream	oh
2015-06-06 22:51:43	Zenther	kernel for example... gentoo latest stable as defined at kernel.org is NOT 4.0.4
2015-06-06 22:51:49	linux_dream	3.18
2015-06-06 22:51:53	Zenther	right
2015-06-06 22:51:57	linux_dream	which was born in april  i think
2015-06-06 22:52:01	linux_dream	not that old really
2015-06-06 22:52:18	linux_dream	but for example... maxima?  it's a computer algebra system
2015-06-06 22:52:18	Zenther	browsers, etc can be same way
2015-06-06 22:52:20	linux_dream	ore firefox
2015-06-06 22:52:23	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 22:53:40	Zenther	there is a way to get more later rolling release, instead of x86_64 in make.conf, you put ~x86_64, like going to 'testing' or unstabel branch
2015-06-06 22:54:25	Zenther	but mixing the two can cause breakages with the dependancies and the version numbers, if you do it, do it early and globally
2015-06-06 22:56:43	Zenther	doing it later when you have a full system built with X, desktop environemnt, all your apps and such and then switching you might end up at a point with circular dependancies, where one software needs the older library file but another wants the new library file.
2015-06-06 22:58:23	linux_dream	I understand
2015-06-06 22:58:39	linux_dream	I'd rather go with stable branch even if not up to date I guess...
2015-06-06 22:59:03	linux_dream	lastly, do you notice any speed difference compared to say, Arch?  When you run firefox, etc
2015-06-06 22:59:06	Zenther	latest is not always greatest
2015-06-06 22:59:11	linux_dream	yeah true
2015-06-06 22:59:57	Zenther	it is compiled to just what you want, so all the kitchen sink isn't included which brings down file size which means faster load time, etc
2015-06-06 23:00:31	Zenther	for example, if you are gnome, you don't need applications that have qt stuff compiled in
2015-06-06 23:00:42	Zenther	you just need the gtk parts
2015-06-06 23:01:16	Zenther	but some software isn't both, it is either gtk or qt
2015-06-06 23:01:45	Zenther	skype for example

2015-06-06 23:03:56	linux_dream	that's awesome...
2015-06-06 23:04:07	Zenther	best to usually keep the make.conf file basic with few entries
2015-06-06 23:04:18	Zenther	on each app you can tell it what you want
2015-06-06 23:04:21	linux_dream	but I'd have to read about flags before I try it

2015-06-06 23:08:00	Zenther	in your portage directory inside of /etc, create a sys-apps file with "sys-apps/portage use= whaT EVER FLAGS TO USE" 
2015-06-06 23:08:11	linux_dream	out of curiosity, how many packages do you have in your gentoo partition?
2015-06-06 23:08:15	Zenther	forget the actual directory portage uses
2015-06-06 23:08:23	Zenther	about 1000
2015-06-06 23:08:37	Zenther	little under, 800-1000 I say
2015-06-06 23:08:39	linux_dream	ok nice, and you're not compiling all the time, even under a low spec laptop
2015-06-06 23:09:17	Zenther	and application in that sys-apps/ branch you just add another line with the package name and it's special use flags
2015-06-06 23:09:34	linux_dream	I see... very nice
2015-06-06 23:09:40	Zenther	that whole thing is explained but not to well in my mind on the wiki
2015-06-06 23:09:45	linux_dream	so you can customize compilation for particular packages
2015-06-06 23:09:49	linux_dream	for future updates
2015-06-06 23:10:35	Zenther	when it goes to update and if it needs to rebuild or download an update and recompile, it re reads that for what use flags to use
2015-06-06 23:10:36	linux_dream	the problem is that I don't really know about flags.   I guess I'd use march=native ..... and the --pulseaudio stuff
2015-06-06 23:10:45	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-06 23:10:59	Zenther	you don't like pulse huh?
2015-06-06 23:11:05	linux_dream	uh I do :)
2015-06-06 23:11:08	linux_dream	sorry
2015-06-06 23:11:20	Zenther	I like multiple mixers as I play sounds from different apps at the same time
2015-06-06 23:11:27	Zenther	alsa only handles one
2015-06-06 23:11:31	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:11:42	Zenther	-pulseaudio tells it to turn it off
2015-06-06 23:11:51	linux_dream	ouch ... I see
2015-06-06 23:11:54	Zenther	the - in front
2015-06-06 23:12:11	linux_dream	a custom kernel too... is tempting
2015-06-06 23:12:22	Zenther	not tempting, need to do one
2015-06-06 23:12:33	linux_dream	in arch I had to blacklist 2 kernel modules, else my laptop won't shutdown nor reboot
2015-06-06 23:12:50	linux_dream	I guess I wouldn't even bother to compile them if I had gentoo
2015-06-06 23:13:02	Zenther	it isn't that hard, esp with genkernel, you can have it compile one like the boot disk or what manjaro uses, it is generic
2015-06-06 23:13:19	linux_dream	hmm why would I want a generic kernel?
2015-06-06 23:13:31	linux_dream	I'd rather select only what I need
2015-06-06 23:13:37	Zenther	out of the box, the kernel has atheros turned off, not there in the kernel or as a module, I had to turn it on and build as a module

2015-06-06 23:15:34	Zenther	there are wiki's for X, and for your desktop environment, and for your video driver, read those as some have you change what is in your kernel
2015-06-06 23:15:41	Batch	is it easier with arch or manjaro
2015-06-06 23:16:07	linux_dream	oh you need to modify your kernel to adapt to newer versions of some DE's ??
2015-06-06 23:16:34	Zenther	linux_dream, no, a kernel loads a module, think of it as a plugin for a kernel, kernel detects I have an atheros wifi card say I don't have a driver built in, let me look for and load the kernel module for it...
2015-06-06 23:16:43	linux_dream	of course Batch , gentoo is not "the easy way" :)   
2015-06-06 23:16:48	Batch	i really really reeeeeally love my manjaro, but if another distro is easier to learn how to compile etc

2015-06-06 23:22:49	Batch	oh oke
2015-06-06 23:23:09	Batch	would be nice if i saw a youtube clip of an example

2015-06-06 23:28:45	Batch	same linux_dream and Zenther 
2015-06-06 23:29:03	<--	Batch (~Batch@unaffiliated/batch) has quit (Quit: Yak yak yak)
2015-06-06 23:29:52	Zenther	better example: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/MPlayer
2015-06-06 23:30:08	Zenther	mplayer is better example of use flags you might want to change
2015-06-06 23:30:38	linux_dream	firefox wiki page has also lots of flags options
2015-06-06 23:30:44	linux_dream	I see yeah
2015-06-06 23:31:06	linux_dream	it's very appealing compared to download firefox and build it with pacman in arch
2015-06-06 23:31:13	Zenther	example, I have a htpc, I use a remote control for fast forward, next, volume up, etc... this uses lirc, so mplayer needs use='lirc' if I want that functionality
2015-06-06 23:31:38	Zenther	by default according to chart, it won't come built in it unless I tell it to
2015-06-06 23:31:52	linux_dream	I see
2015-06-06 23:32:08	linux_dream	so by default usually the builts are minimal
2015-06-06 23:32:20	Zenther	same, x264 is turned off by default, bet you have some of those on your system... lol
2015-06-06 23:32:22	linux_dream	and one must enable most of the functionalities
2015-06-06 23:32:48	linux_dream	lol x264?  never seen that before
2015-06-06 23:32:51	Zenther	so, always take your time, look for a gentoo wiki and that app's use flags
2015-06-06 23:32:59	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-06 23:33:01	Zenther	you are joking right?
2015-06-06 23:33:06	linux_dream	no
2015-06-06 23:33:16	linux_dream	what's x264?
2015-06-06 23:33:28	Zenther	x264 is a popular video codec now
2015-06-06 23:33:36	linux_dream	ah welll..
2015-06-06 23:33:40	linux_dream	I don't even have vlc
2015-06-06 23:33:45	linux_dream	i don't watch videos
2015-06-06 23:33:58	linux_dream	youtube is enough for m e
2015-06-06 23:34:24	Zenther	well, that is an example, hopefully you get the idea of use= flags
2015-06-06 23:34:29	linux_dream	yes I do
2015-06-06 23:34:48	linux_dream	but for some programs like "maxima", there's no wiki page
2015-06-06 23:35:06	linux_dream	so... to build it... not sure emerge would find it?
2015-06-06 23:35:16	linux_dream	I'd have to build it from sourceforge?
2015-06-06 23:35:22	Zenther	and as I said, don't throw the kitchen sink listing of use flags in make.conf, make a file in the right directory with a line for each app, better organization that way
2015-06-06 23:35:29	linux_dream	(I've done it... no big deal... but just want to make sure)
2015-06-06 23:35:50	Zenther	emerge is like yaourt, it get's the ebuild file and that tells it how to do it
2015-06-06 23:36:03	-->	tumbler (~tumbler@adsl-ull-46-92.49-151.net24.it) has joined #manjaro
2015-06-06 23:36:12	linux_dream	yeah but the repository is not as big as the AUR right?
2015-06-06 23:36:28	Zenther	fairly big
2015-06-06 23:36:35	linux_dream	is "maxima" computer algebra software available in emerge?
2015-06-06 23:36:42	Zenther	as big as arch's official plus aur, don't think so
2015-06-06 23:36:51	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:37:07	Zenther	sci-mathematics/maxima - Packages at Gentoo Linux
2015-06-06 23:37:09	linux_dream	so I'd have to build those programs from sourceforge/github myself
2015-06-06 23:37:18	linux_dream	oh wow
2015-06-06 23:37:23	linux_dream	it is there.. nice
2015-06-06 23:37:23	Zenther	https://packages.gentoo.org/package/sci-mathematics/maxima
2015-06-06 23:37:58	Zenther	5.34.1 is latest stable, have to use the '~' to get latest 5.36.1
2015-06-06 23:38:39	linux_dream	in manjaro i have the 5.35-1
2015-06-06 23:38:44	Zenther	~amd64.... forget they don't use the x86_64 naming... I hate calling it amd, I use an intel damn it!
2015-06-06 23:38:52	linux_dream	lol
2015-06-06 23:39:13	linux_dream	me too but it's amd who invented this arch I think
2015-06-06 23:39:50	Zenther	don't care, intel would have gone to 64 bit, it was inevitable
2015-06-06 23:39:58	Zenther	amd just did it before them
2015-06-06 23:40:27	linux_dream	lol
2015-06-06 23:40:32	Zenther	marketing...
2015-06-06 23:40:38	linux_dream	no idea if research is linear and predictable
2015-06-06 23:40:52	linux_dream	but in that case probably yes
2015-06-06 23:41:16	Zenther	have to go, ran out of 32 bit memory addresses
2015-06-06 23:41:50	Zenther	unless you use a -pxe kernel but even those are being dropped
2015-06-06 23:43:01	linux_dream	so with gentoo the hardest and longest part is basically installing the system ?
2015-06-06 23:43:17	Zenther	time consuming
2015-06-06 23:43:22	linux_dream	ouch :(
2015-06-06 23:43:28	linux_dream	like 2 or 3 days?
2015-06-06 23:43:38	Zenther	for the basic system
2015-06-06 23:43:56	Zenther	with x and your desktop
2015-06-06 23:44:09	Zenther	then you need to install all your apps
2015-06-06 23:44:12	linux_dream	luckily i use lightweight DE
2015-06-06 23:44:19	linux_dream	i don't have much apps
2015-06-06 23:44:23	Zenther	lot of time spent on the different wiki pages
2015-06-06 23:44:34	linux_dream	in arch, about 560 packages so far and I have baically all instaled
2015-06-06 23:44:39	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:45:10	Zenther	oh, and out of the box, openrc is standard, you have to tell it early on if you want a systemd if you want that the easiest way
2015-06-06 23:45:36	linux_dream	I guess I'd go with openrc and dump systemd
2015-06-06 23:45:38	Zenther	what processor do you have? how many cores?
2015-06-06 23:45:53	linux_dream	core i3  (only 1.8 GHz), 2 cores
2015-06-06 23:45:56	linux_dream	it's a laptop
2015-06-06 23:46:08	Zenther	oh boy
2015-06-06 23:46:17	linux_dream	I'm going to suffer i know
2015-06-06 23:46:23	linux_dream	if I ever go for gentoo
2015-06-06 23:46:31	Zenther	well, a what will get you is any webkit compile and any browser compile
2015-06-06 23:46:34	linux_dream	I'd rather wait and get some 8 cores desktop pc :)
2015-06-06 23:46:45	Zenther	on 2 cores, those take hours
2015-06-06 23:47:18	linux_dream	yeah maybe I should wait 1 year or so.  when I get a desktop pc
2015-06-06 23:47:43	linux_dream	but I want to learn about gentoo as much as I can, before installing it
2015-06-06 23:47:49	linux_dream	so I don't get lost
2015-06-06 23:47:58	Zenther	some packages have binary equivalents that might be used, libreoffice is one I know of, you can either compile it, or use their precomiled binary one
2015-06-06 23:48:08	linux_dream	I'd rather compile it
2015-06-06 23:48:22	linux_dream	even if takes 40 hours
2015-06-06 23:48:23	Zenther	libreoffice takes a long time to compile also
2015-06-06 23:48:37	Zenther	well, keep it plugged into the wall
2015-06-06 23:48:49	linux_dream	it's always plugged into the wall
2015-06-06 23:49:02	linux_dream	the battery is internal, cna't remove it.
2015-06-06 23:49:17	linux_dream	since I'm at home I don't bother to unplg it
2015-06-06 23:49:34	Zenther	imagine a desktop, 6 hours into compiling chromium and lighting strikes making the computer reset... all that time lost... lol
2015-06-06 23:49:48	linux_dream	yeah that would hurt
2015-06-06 23:50:02	linux_dream	but that would rarely happen
2015-06-06 23:50:35	Zenther	and in make.conf file... with it a 2 core, you will need a line: MAKEOPT="-j3"
2015-06-06 23:50:40	linux_dream	6 hours to build chromium man this is mindblowing
2015-06-06 23:50:48	Zenther	always one more than the number of cores you have
2015-06-06 23:50:55	Zenther	tells it to use all of them
2015-06-06 23:51:03	linux_dream	I've read twice as much as number of cores
2015-06-06 23:51:18	linux_dream	I've got 2 cores but 4 threads  (hyperthreading)
2015-06-06 23:51:27	Zenther	yes, like I said, any browser or like webkit-gtk, webkit-qt is like that
2015-06-06 23:51:37	Zenther	libreoffice too I think
2015-06-06 23:51:38	linux_dream	this hurts lol
2015-06-06 23:51:57	Zenther	ok, then you use -j5
2015-06-06 23:52:37	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:53:17	Zenther	later, when you have it built, if you are also working on it while you plan to do an update, you can lower that number so it doesn't take all your processor from you
2015-06-06 23:53:22	linux_dream	and how do you keep up to date ?  a single update per week say on weekend?   or as soon as updates are available ?
2015-06-06 23:53:36	linux_dream	ok I get it
2015-06-06 23:53:42	Zenther	but while building it, max it out, you are building it and cannot really work anyways
2015-06-06 23:54:07	Zenther	don't do updates unless you have time to let it do it's thing
2015-06-06 23:54:20	<--	shndns (~michael@ip68-99-216-74.ph.ph.cox.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-06-06 23:54:31	Zenther	never do an update when you ahve a big project to get done and cannot afford the computer down time
2015-06-06 23:54:38	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:54:40	Zenther	'weekends' are good
2015-06-06 23:54:49	Zenther	really same goes for manjaro/arch
2015-06-06 23:54:58	linux_dream	hm
2015-06-06 23:55:02	Zenther	you never know, an update might break something
2015-06-06 23:55:09	linux_dream	yeah true
2015-06-06 23:55:27	linux_dream	when it's a particular program i guess it doesn't matter, easy to downgrade
2015-06-06 23:55:37	Zenther	don't do it before some report needs to be done for school or before a presentation for work... lol
2015-06-06 23:55:46	linux_dream	happened to me yesterday with rstudio-desktop-bin package from the aur
2015-06-06 23:55:54	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-06 23:56:42	Zenther	sometimes it isn't easy to figure out which package borked the system on an update
2015-06-06 23:57:40	linux_dream	especially in manjaro i guess... siince they come by packs
2015-06-06 23:57:46	Zenther	for me, deluge is borked up, dealing with it until another update... not deluge's problem, it's with the mime type (xdg) associated with magnet links
2015-06-06 23:58:28	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-06 23:58:38	Zenther	my magnet links open deluge, but xdg-open screws up the magnet link and the torrent never shows up
2015-06-06 23:58:53	linux_dream	Isee..
2015-06-06 23:59:04	Zenther	I have to manually download the torrent right now instead of clicking a magnet link

2015-06-07 00:00:30	linux_dream	did you made a feedback
2015-06-07 00:00:32	Zenther	even quick is the next day... not good if you need something for work and it is down due to an update
2015-06-07 00:00:32	linux_dream	hi loner269 
2015-06-07 00:00:40	linux_dream	yes true
2015-06-07 00:00:51	linux_dream	but you can easily downgrade? or not..
2015-06-07 00:01:33	Zenther	linux_dream, it has been reported to the xdg-open upstream devs... not arch, not manjaro issue, it is upstream... and it is not deluge, it is xdg-open bug but is noticed only in deluge... lol
2015-06-07 00:01:58	linux_dream	ouch
2015-06-07 00:02:02	Zenther	I laugh when someone comes in here and asks where to report a bug

2015-06-07 00:03:29	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-07 00:03:43	linux_dream	and their "community" packages are sometimes AUR's ones
2015-06-07 00:03:53	linux_dream	like the package "downgrade" to downgrade aur packages
2015-06-07 00:04:05	Zenther	mostly, kernel, video drivers, tools like mhwd are manjaro, rest is from arch
2015-06-07 00:04:12	Zenther	there are some exceptions though...
2015-06-07 00:04:23	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:04:33	Zenther	philm does broadcom-wl wifi driver - in arch it is only in aur
2015-06-07 00:04:43	Zenther	I asked him to include that... lol
2015-06-07 00:04:49	linux_dream	nice
2015-06-07 00:05:16	Zenther	that is what wifi driver I have on this box, hard to get installed if I don't have wifi and it is in the aur!
2015-06-07 00:06:15	Zenther	arch's answer is go someplace and plug in my nic card.... yea, let me box up my full tower case and go looking for someplace to do that... lol
2015-06-07 00:06:29	linux_dream	I see...
2015-06-07 00:06:40	linux_dream	so you installed manjaro??
2015-06-07 00:06:48	Zenther	at the time
2015-06-07 00:06:50	linux_dream	or you could make it with arch?

2015-06-07 00:09:34	Zenther	one used to be manjaro, but I was gone for 6 months and the kernel went out of date
2015-06-07 00:10:13	Zenther	wouldn't let me install a new kernel becuase my system wasn't up to date and couldn't update the system because the kernel was too old to update and no longer supported
2015-06-07 00:10:15	linux_dream	and  that was a problem?
2015-06-07 00:10:15	Zenther	lol
2015-06-07 00:10:21	linux_dream	LOL
2015-06-07 00:10:29	linux_dream	really? 
2015-06-07 00:10:40	linux_dream	gosh this is... crazy
2015-06-07 00:10:48	Zenther	so..... always keep the latest lts kernel on hand!
2015-06-07 00:10:54	linux_dream	:D
2015-06-07 00:11:19	linux_dream	well with newer manjaro iso, it would be possible to install a newer kernel i guess

2015-06-07 00:11:55	Zenther	yea, could have manually done it... pacman -U a new kernel outside the system
2015-06-07 00:12:07	Zenther	after downloading it manually
2015-06-07 00:12:20	Zenther	reboot, then do a -Syu
2015-06-07 00:12:26	linux_dream	would such thing happen in arch?  I guess not?
2015-06-07 00:12:33	Zenther	but I decided just to put arch on it
2015-06-07 00:12:37	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:13:11	Zenther	well, it can happen in arch too in a way, but they don't have multiple kernels like manjaro does
2015-06-07 00:13:26	Zenther	just linux-version-number
2015-06-07 00:13:50	Zenther	not linux310-version number and linux318-version-number
2015-06-07 00:13:51	linux_dream	and linux-lts
2015-06-07 00:13:56	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-07 00:14:04	Manj-811-Xfce2	after installing manjaro when i am opening add and remove software application it not asking for root password
2015-06-07 00:14:41	Zenther	so in arch, linux goes to newer linux, manjaro you cannot just have pacman -Syu and go linux310 to linux400 for example
2015-06-07 00:15:18	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:15:44	Zenther	manjaro will go linuix318-3.18.3 to linux318-3.18.8 but not to linux400-4.0.4
2015-06-07 00:15:47	linux_dream	it's ok Manj-811-Xfce2 
2015-06-07 00:16:09	linux_dream	you'll be asked your password if you add or remove software
2015-06-07 00:16:22	linux_dream	not when you start the program itself
2015-06-07 00:16:34	Zenther	Manj-811-Xfce2, it is free to look at software, if you want to update or install or remove, then it will ask
2015-06-07 00:17:06	linux_dream	Zenther, to increase stability, some Arch people "freeze" their kernel version??
2015-06-07 00:17:17	Zenther	no
2015-06-07 00:17:25	linux_dream	like they tell pacman to ignore kernel updates
2015-06-07 00:17:26	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:17:38	linux_dream	then it's 1 generic kernel for everyone??
2015-06-07 00:17:53	sluckxz	seems like this is still relevant regarding 256 xfce xterm? https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=175581
2015-06-07 00:18:02	linux_dream	(except from the linux-ck and stuff like that in the aur)
2015-06-07 00:18:05	Zenther	don't freeze unless you know an update will bork it, then if it does, downgrade then freeze until another newer package, then unfreeze again
2015-06-07 00:18:14	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:18:27	Zenther	freezing packages will eventually break a system too... called partial updates
2015-06-07 00:18:56	Zenther	that is when you get into gentoo's world of circular dependancies
2015-06-07 00:19:14	linux_dream	sounds scary
2015-06-07 00:19:48	Zenther	if you cannot afford the new thing, then stay what you have and just don't update
2015-06-07 00:20:10	Zenther	wait... till you can afford the time or newer version
2015-06-07 00:20:17	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:20:57	Zenther	also, best not to update in manjaro right away... lol... ssshhh... I didn't say that... but wait a couple of days, listen for issues from others

2015-06-07 00:22:13	Zenther	arch updates are daily, none to 20 packages or so, manjaro are weekly and huge in comparison because they come all at once
2015-06-07 00:23:06	Zenther	manjaro is still a small community and realatively speaking not many people use the 'testing' repo 
2015-06-07 00:24:13	Zenther	and, if it is a weekly update, then it at MOST spent a week in testing... some may have been there only one day
2015-06-07 00:25:11	linux_dream	yeah
2015-06-07 00:25:28	linux_dream	but testing branch in manjaro is "stable " branch in arch or so... close to this
2015-06-07 00:25:54	linux_dream	but yeah manjaro updates are huge
2015-06-07 00:26:08	linux_dream	I prefer tons of small ones  but that's my personal taste
2015-06-07 00:26:41	Zenther	well, one could choose to change to the 'unstable' that branch is just an hour or so behind arch
2015-06-07 00:27:18	Zenther	I don't know how often they pull, hourly, every 4 hours, definately isn't once a day as it is more often than that
2015-06-07 00:28:11	Zenther	when I was on manjaro, I used the unstable branch
2015-06-07 00:28:16	linux_dream	ok
2015-06-07 00:28:37	Zenther	but I wouldn't recommend it for a noob

2015-06-07 01:41:30	Zenther	You no longer need to recompile Cinnamon to choose between consolekit and logind support. This is done in gsettings and you can decide which relevant Cinnamon components use which session/power-management backend:
2015-06-07 01:41:40	+ringo32	dconf
2015-06-07 01:41:44	Zenther	http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2015/06/cinnamon-2-6/
2015-06-07 01:42:03	Zenther	Set org.cinnamon.desktop.session session-manager-uses-logind to true to make Cinnamon rely on logind to restart/shutdown/suspend/hibernate the computer from the shutdown dialog, or to false to restart/shutdown the computer via consolekit and suspend/hibernate via upower.
2015-06-07 01:42:52	Zenther	MDM unlock via logind support is introduced in version 2.0
2015-06-07 01:43:02	Zenther	next excuse?
2015-06-07 01:43:55	+ringo32	Zenther,  if i make one, you install it ? :)

2015-06-07 01:46:38	+ringo32	intresting upstream  applets in repo
2015-06-07 01:47:24	Zenther	funny windows removed all applets for desktop due to security issues and linux still has them
2015-06-07 01:48:15	Zenther	hate one update with nemo
2015-06-07 01:48:15	Zenther	right click menu is way smaller... no longer has 'show hidden files' in right click menu
2015-06-07 01:48:58	Zenther	now I have to go to nemo's men at top to change it or move hands to keyboard for ctrl-h
2015-06-07 01:49:19	Zenther	men/menu*
2015-06-07 01:49:50	+ringo32	ok
2015-06-07 01:50:10	+ringo32	like in mate xscreensaver support mmmm
2015-06-07 01:50:14	Zenther	unless I manually added that to nemo's right click menu before and forgot I did
2015-06-07 01:50:23	Zenther	just know I used to have that one
2015-06-07 01:52:11	Zenther	god I hate deluge, have it set to download 2 in the queue at a time, look and it is doing 8... double check, yes - 2. Close it, open it back up and it is downloading 3 at a time.... grrrrrr!
2015-06-07 01:55:02	+ringo32	time to make a new cinnamon iso :)
2015-06-07 01:57:00	Zenther	what terminal you using in it?
2015-06-07 01:57:45	+ringo32	gnome-terminal :)
2015-06-07 02:02:55	+ringo32	Zenther,  which terminal is better then ?
2015-06-07 02:07:43	+ringo32	?
2015-06-07 02:08:06	Zenther	I don't know, in gnome-terminal can you have it set to transparent yet?
2015-06-07 02:08:20	Zenther	I know they removed it, don't know if they put it back in
2015-06-07 02:08:47	+ringo32	i need to setup cinnamon repo intoo my iso hmm
2015-06-07 02:08:49	Zenther	when they took it out, I changed to xfce4-terminal because I like it semi-transparent
2015-06-07 02:09:39	Zenther	but if you change it, there is a setting you have to change so that nemo's right click 'open in terminal' will open the right terminal, default is gnome-terminal 
2015-06-07 02:10:28	+ringo32	i think i keep gnome-terminal is always a battle which terminal is better
2015-06-07 02:16:10	ediT	 > hmmm
2015-06-07 02:16:44	+ringo32	Zenther,  mdm , cinnamon load in does also take some time
2015-06-07 02:16:54	Zenther	ringo32, are you including 'blueberry'?

2015-06-07 02:25:00	Zenther	but again, cinnamon-bluetooth is 3.8, that is OLD! flagged out of date
2015-06-07 02:25:23	Zenther	that's why they went new in linuxmint with blueberry
2015-06-07 02:26:03	+ringo32	but linuxmint these thays you can say, they are desktop focus distro
2015-06-07 02:26:35	+ringo32	for beginners is good

2015-06-07 02:27:54	Zenther	and you are doing Cinnamon ISO
2015-06-07 02:28:03	Zenther	that is why I bring it up
2015-06-07 02:28:06	+ringo32	but i dont have repo's to add it :)
2015-06-07 02:28:17	+ringo32	also to much work :-)
2015-06-07 02:28:38	+ringo32	my opportunity is to keep iso simple and stable,
2015-06-07 02:28:41	Zenther	you can add packages from the aur into the iso can you not?
2015-06-07 02:28:49	+ringo32	also i gona add cinnamon repo to the iso
2015-06-07 02:28:59	+ringo32	i must packagebuild
2015-06-07 02:29:06	Zenther	yes
2015-06-07 02:29:07	+ringo32	then local repo or something
2015-06-07 02:29:44	Zenther	I know other iso's come with aur packages
2015-06-07 02:30:39	+ringo32	what is usefull to add aur packages ?
2015-06-07 02:30:46	Zenther	if the package is of use

2015-06-07 02:32:19	+ringo32	thats also true thats why i think to rebuild the iso in 8.13 more ad .1 after it
2015-06-07 02:32:43	+ringo32	but always wanted a basic iso not more or less
2015-06-07 02:32:58	+ringo32	basicly iso is also to much bloated on someways
2015-06-07 02:33:02	Zenther	but the ones that have 13 won't have it, only the ones on 13.1 will
2015-06-07 02:33:43	Zenther	don't know why blueberry hasn't been picked up as an official arch yet, maybe too new yet
2015-06-07 02:34:07	+ringo32	write a email to the maintainer
2015-06-07 02:34:38	Zenther	cinnamon dev for arch would have to adopt it
2015-06-07 02:34:55	Zenther	or... should I mean
2015-06-07 02:35:51	Zenther	or the what's the other de.... damn... gnome2 fork....

2015-06-09 10:04:32	+Strit_Laptop	justasking, well, you could try re-installing the keyrings "sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring manjaro-keyring". That's how signatures are handled.
2015-06-09 10:05:20	peetaur2	I find it silly to sign the checksums instead of the iso itself.
2015-06-09 10:05:22	justasking	thx, but thats for my repository right? ... my question is about installing the system with an verified iso
2015-06-09 10:05:33	justasking	no, its fast peetaur2
2015-06-09 10:05:45	justasking	its common practice

2015-06-09 10:08:18	peetaur2	just get to the "please wait x seconds even though that won't help since you disabled javascript, or click _here___" and then copy the link there, and add https and use wget

2015-06-09 12:01:00	fes	ringo32, maybe you know how to easily see which driver is being used (nouveau or nvidia)?
2015-06-09 12:01:07	+ringo32	is only gnome ?
2015-06-09 12:01:57	fes	well I notice it when gnome 3's animated things like "flying" program icons appear. they are much more slugish than when I try the liveiso
2015-06-09 12:02:32	+ringo32	without updating ?
2015-06-09 12:02:36	fes	maybe the installed system use the free nouveau drivers instead of the non free in liveiso
2015-06-09 12:02:48	+ringo32	you use basicly intel
2015-06-09 12:03:14	manjaro-kde5-	if I resize the vlc window several times, sometimes the pixel distortion will go away, but I'm left with weird horizontal aliasing: http://tinypic.com/r/sxym9z/8
2015-06-09 12:03:15	+ringo32	or you turn nvidia on somehow

2015-06-09 12:11:47	+Jolt2bolt	is like you only know one thing is ok, but really? are you that short of mind?
2015-06-09 12:12:01	potmo	one of the english speakers on #arch told me to avoid manjaro because "when it updates it breaks itself" others say it completely abandons the "arch way" I'd like to hear some people who use manjaro what their opinion is 
2015-06-09 12:12:24	potmo	but I guess this is more of a support channel so never mind
2015-06-09 12:12:30	+Jolt2bolt	not me manjaro-kde5-, can you try a diferent desktop or enviroment?

2015-06-09 12:13:29	+Jolt2bolt	potmo, well I can tell much, but like the say, manjaro is not the ARCH way, because is NOT archlinux so...
2015-06-09 12:13:39	potmo	right I get that
2015-06-09 12:13:45	peetaur2	ringo32: I mean like if you look for a pgp signature, there isn't one. And if you try to download the sha256sum file via https, it redirects you to http   wget "https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/manjarolinux/release/0.8.12/xfce/manjaro-0.8.12-sha256sum.txt"
2015-06-09 12:13:51	+Jolt2bolt	well we try to help in what we know
2015-06-09 12:13:51	manjaro-kde5-	potmo: you probably won't get stuck. It's pretty straight forward, not like a from-scratch arch install
2015-06-09 12:14:00	potmo	and there is a lot to be said for the arch way but I need a little user-friendliness in my old age
2015-06-09 12:14:04	+Jolt2bolt	try that in archlinux and yoiu get pwned!:P

2015-06-09 12:21:18	+Jolt2bolt	aha so the struture of the system work like archlinux but is not archlinux entirely
2015-06-09 12:21:30	+Jolt2bolt	like the repos
2015-06-09 12:21:44	+Jolt2bolt	and some app you can't find in archlinux for example
2015-06-09 12:21:49	+Jolt2bolt	are manjaro only
2015-06-09 12:21:53	potmo	I guess I don't really understand difference in distros
2015-06-09 12:21:53	H-H-H	mhwd
2015-06-09 12:22:22	H-H-H	lol its like aski8ng whats the difference between ubuntyu and centos when they are all based around the kernel
2015-06-09 12:22:33	potmo	right 
2015-06-09 12:22:38	H-H-H	ubuntu lol not ubuntyu
2015-06-09 12:22:40	potmo	exactly what it is like
2015-06-09 12:23:00	+Jolt2bolt	ubuntu...
2015-06-09 12:23:04	potmo	why would you not be debian based what about this distro makes it arch based
2015-06-09 12:23:12	+Jolt2bolt	i still don't like debian based distro..
2015-06-09 12:23:16	peetaur2	potmo: manjaro is basically arch with an installer and mhwd which makes video driver installing easy, and stabler packages (they are tested more when they come from arch)
2015-06-09 12:23:24	+Jolt2bolt	is a mess in the package manage system
2015-06-09 12:23:26	Zenther	most of the packages comes directly from arch. what does not is that manjaro has it's own kernel and drivers. Manjaro also modifies pacman to work their way. Manjaro also has it's own tool set like mhwd to easily install kernel branches and change video drivers.
2015-06-09 12:23:28	+Jolt2bolt	i don't like
2015-06-09 12:23:40	peetaur2	potmo: and debian uses apt, but manjaro/arch use pacman
2015-06-09 12:23:46	H-H-H	yeah what zenther said
2015-06-09 12:23:48	potmo	so ok archbase #1 pacman 
2015-06-09 12:23:59	+Jolt2bolt	well debian use atp/aptitude
2015-06-09 12:24:11	+Jolt2bolt	I don't know why have two tool for that
2015-06-09 12:24:21	+Jolt2bolt	pacman is so nice
2015-06-09 12:24:23	H-H-H	but i also use pacman in my distro lol but am not arch based
2015-06-09 12:24:24	+Jolt2bolt	i love pancam
2015-06-09 12:24:38	+Jolt2bolt	I still use archlinux only for pacman
2015-06-09 12:25:18	peetaur2	it is "arch based" because the packages come from arch... same versions, same patches
2015-06-09 12:25:27	potmo	so initial install comes with the non AUR parts of the arch system and adds a bunch of DEs and makes initial install leave you ready to go with working system. Is this fair description?
2015-06-09 12:25:51	+Jolt2bolt	is so simple and still so... perfect... don't waste time and space, just works...
2015-06-09 12:25:59	Zenther	not sure with whay you mean the non aur parts
2015-06-09 12:26:13	H-H-H	nope as it does have aur access via yoaurt
2015-06-09 12:26:17	potmo	well for me whenever I was downloading a package there was no diff between apt and pacman
2015-06-09 12:26:19	+Jolt2bolt	manjaro came with yaourt installed so...
2015-06-09 12:26:24	peetaur2	it comes installed without aur though.. and then you can add aur packages
2015-06-09 12:26:24	Zenther	manjaro has some packages as official that in arch are only in the aur... broadcom-wl driver for example
2015-06-09 12:26:29	potmo	but I like the whole makepkg thing
2015-06-09 12:26:33	+Jolt2bolt	apt is more slow than pacman
2015-06-09 12:26:40	Zenther	you have full access to the aur in manjaro
2015-06-09 12:26:44	+Jolt2bolt	I can asure that
2015-06-09 12:26:54	H-H-H	peetaur2 aur cant be installed
2015-06-09 12:26:54	potmo	ok but core stuff is identical 
2015-06-09 12:27:07	potmo	lel that wold be crz
2015-06-09 12:27:14	Zenther	manjaro comes with base-devel meta group for compiling and yaourt for aur access. Arch does not.
2015-06-09 12:27:45	potmo	yeah the base-devel meta group is very attractive to me
2015-06-09 12:27:46	H-H-H	potmo not all the core stuff is the same
2015-06-09 12:27:55	H-H-H	manjaro uses its own bash for example
2015-06-09 12:27:58	peetaur2	H-H-H: ?
2015-06-09 12:28:03	+ringo32	Zenther,  hah
2015-06-09 12:28:10	peetaur2	aur packages, and tools that install aur packages, can be installed
2015-06-09 12:28:15	+Jolt2bolt	Zenther, but you normally install base and base-devel when you install arch, right?
2015-06-09 12:28:16	potmo	you mean default shell hhh?
2015-06-09 12:28:19	H-H-H	<<peetaur2>> it comes installed without aur though.. and then you can add aur packages
2015-06-09 12:28:36	H-H-H	aur cannot be installed but packages from the aur can be
2015-06-09 12:28:55	potmo	right arch is same way
2015-06-09 12:29:04	+Jolt2bolt	install aur manually is so fun sometime:d
2015-06-09 12:29:04	Zenther	Jolt2bolt, it is typical that people install it in arch. But it is not shipped with it. You have to tell it to install it after system install.

2015-06-09 12:29:56	peetaur2	H-H-H: no they can't... they can be built, but aur has no packages :P    why bother arguing about semantics?
2015-06-09 12:30:04	+Jolt2bolt	bloq mayus activate
2015-06-09 12:30:21	H-H-H	so what do you do with them aftrer they are built ?
2015-06-09 12:31:05	H-H-H	install them perhaps?
2015-06-09 12:31:19	potmo	right but building packages from aur is pretty trivial with makepkg no?
2015-06-09 12:31:28	peetaur2	you install the packages you build, which are based on the source that is downlodaed by the PKGBUILD on aur, but the packages themselves are not on AUR. (I am exaggerating to make a point that semantics are just boring and useless to argue about, and am not serious)

2015-06-09 12:32:59	H-H-H	i personally think the aur is awesome and manjaro should make thier own :)

2015-06-09 12:35:16	Zenther	H-H-H, I imagine this switch will clean all the old orphaned packages out of the system too
2015-06-09 12:35:36	potmo	poor little orphans
2015-06-09 12:35:50	Zenther	as the devels have only 30 days to claim their current pkgbuilds as maintainers on the new system

2015-06-09 12:37:03	peetaur2	I would not like them to remove old packages.. I have taken many old outdated things and then modified them to work on my os (http://aur.archlinux.org/ and then download tarball, and then makepkg there)
2015-06-09 12:37:26	potmo	so there's no pacman -Syu though right you just update every so often or ...?
2015-06-09 12:37:27	peetaur2	or even just chose specific versions to build instead of the suggested ones
2015-06-09 12:37:41	peetaur2	potmo: pacman -Syu is how you would update every so often ...
2015-06-09 12:38:01	+Jolt2bolt	potmo, I'm on archlinux system and I only update every now and then
2015-06-09 12:38:02	H-H-H	potmo no reason really except i have witnessed hostility towards manjaro from arch and it wouldnt suprise me if arch decided to try and make it hard for manjaro to use the aur bearing in mind that the aur is meant for arch users lol
2015-06-09 12:38:13	Zenther	Between June 8th and July 8th, all AUR maintainers are expected to transition their packages over to aur4. On August 8th, the aur4 subdomain will be renamed aur and the previous AUR will be retired. This change should not affect end users in any way. AUR maintainers though, obviously, are affected.

2015-06-09 12:45:21	potmo	well there are def negative opinions of manjaro on the arch channel but not in a derogatory way and in general it seems to me arch is pretty respectful of other distros, knowing that they aren't for everybody
2015-06-09 12:45:37	potmo	but @holes will be @holes
2015-06-09 12:45:48	Zenther	H-H-H, you mean aur4.archlinux.org
2015-06-09 12:46:02	potmo	you can d/l tarballs from AUR off the web, no?

2015-06-09 12:47:10	H-H-H	yep ty
2015-06-09 12:47:15	potmo	you can see how arch would attract snobs though because of its geeky philosophy (which I love and hate)
2015-06-09 12:47:40	Zenther	H-H-H, in a month they will just rename aur4 to aur
2015-06-09 12:48:06	H-H-H	yep i was just curiose if they chaanged the web frontend much :)_
2015-06-09 12:48:30	potmo	maybe they will leave graveyard of old unmaintained packages from old AUR 
2015-06-09 12:48:44	potmo	I guess most/many are hosted on github anyway?
2015-06-09 12:48:47	Zenther	manjaro has a new pkgquery and yaourt in the works for the switch
2015-06-09 12:49:35	potmo	so yaort gives you graphic interface and does makepkg for you right? It doesn't do anything fancy like check for updates does it?
2015-06-09 12:49:57	Zenther	potmo, yaourt is command line, works almost same as pacman

2015-06-09 12:50:25	Zenther	potmo, yaourt will update official packages and those from the aur: yaourt -Syua
2015-06-09 12:51:05	Zenther	although I am anal and let only pacman do official, so I do: sudo pacman -Syu && yaourt -Syua
2015-06-09 12:51:06	potmo	so pacman -Syu won't ?
2015-06-09 12:51:22	+Jolt2bolt	lol I had ages i didn't update aur packages
2015-06-09 12:51:29	Zenther	potmo, pacman will only do official packages, not from the aur
2015-06-09 12:51:32	+Jolt2bolt	thanks
2015-06-09 12:51:33	+Jolt2bolt	xDD
2015-06-09 12:51:37	potmo	ah ok 
2015-06-09 12:52:06	potmo	so keeps your updates from breaking when there are dependencies when it involves an AUR package ...?
2015-06-09 12:52:07	Zenther	yaourt -Syua is the same as yaourt -Syu --aur
2015-06-09 12:52:41	Zenther	potmo, the aur maintainer sets the dependancies in that package's pkgbuild file
2015-06-09 12:52:58	potmo	so yaourt can work on any repository then not just AUR?
2015-06-09 12:53:39	Zenther	yes, it will also do the official base, community, extra
2015-06-09 12:53:49	Zenther	but for those, I only use pacman
2015-06-09 12:53:50	potmo	but basically I get pacman functionality for the AUR 
2015-06-09 12:54:22	potmo	ok but you guys don't have base, community and extra right you guys have stable, unstable and something else right?
2015-06-09 12:55:02	Zenther	there is still base, community, extra
2015-06-09 12:55:04	+Strit_Laptop	potmo, we do have base, etc. stable and unstable are different repo sets.
2015-06-09 12:55:21	Zenther	each one of those has a stable, testing, and unstable section to it

2015-06-09 12:57:03	Zenther	potmo, unstable is rsync file copy from arch repositories about an hour behind or so plus it's own manjaro packages

2015-06-09 12:57:31	potmo	ahah and then someone goes through updates with fine tooth comb to make it meet manjaro standards?
2015-06-09 12:57:37	potmo	and that's where stable comes from?
2015-06-09 12:57:39	Zenther	potmo, basically, unstable is just like arch, package updates all day long, every day
2015-06-09 12:57:58	+Jolt2bolt	manjaro testing is like archlinux stable release!:P
2015-06-09 12:58:22	+Jolt2bolt	really
2015-06-09 12:58:40	+Jolt2bolt	I believed that testing was like archlinux realease
2015-06-09 12:58:42	Zenther	after a bit, philm will dump them into testing, there they sit for up to a week or so and depending on feedback from users he either holds them as they are broke or pushes them to stable
2015-06-09 12:58:56	Zenther	hence, in manjaro you only see an update about once a week
2015-06-09 12:59:15	+Jolt2bolt	in arch is all day long!:D
2015-06-09 12:59:28	potmo	so not so much changes as QT and if bugs then no update yes?
2015-06-09 12:59:35	+Jolt2bolt	aha
2015-06-09 12:59:42	Zenther	arch testing > arch stable > manjaro unstable > manjaro testing > manjaro stable
2015-06-09 12:59:43	+Jolt2bolt	that's why i use archlinux
2015-06-09 12:59:53	+Jolt2bolt	i blike bleddinedge baby

2015-06-09 23:21:21	arkasizer_	linux_dream, When I used gentoo I used to do it all the time
2015-06-09 23:21:48	linux_dream	arkasizer_, so you had access to lots of packages that emerge couldn't find otherwise?
2015-06-09 23:22:01	Zenther	by tar balls, I mean .deb, .rpm, and arch's pkg
2015-06-09 23:22:16	Zenther	you can open them with file-roller

2015-06-09 23:22:49	linux_dream	amazing
2015-06-09 23:22:57	Zenther	blackarch is just a bunch of separate little or sub packages
2015-06-09 23:23:00	linux_dream	and why did you leave gentoo?
2015-06-09 23:23:17	arkasizer_	linux_dream, updating takes too long, literally 2 days for a full update
2015-06-09 23:23:19	Zenther	it is not up to date as arch
2015-06-09 23:23:23	Batch	oh
2015-06-09 23:23:35	linux_dream	updating every week you mean arkasizer_ ?
2015-06-09 23:23:49	Batch	well i see in blackarch irc they do alot of pulls and commits
2015-06-09 23:23:52	arkasizer_	linux_dream, I would use because i'm a freak like that
2015-06-09 23:24:10	linux_dream	arkasizer_, i was thinking to wipe out manjaro for gentoo
2015-06-09 23:24:24	Batch	but i'm not really following it anyway
2015-06-09 23:24:29	arkasizer_	linux_dream, I wouldn't.  Manjaro for Arch I would understand
2015-06-09 23:24:39	Zenther	I wouldn't wipe manjaro/arch for gentoo

2015-06-09 23:30:16	linux_dream	so openrc falls short vs systemd?
2015-06-09 23:30:24	linux_dream	and I've read that  gentoo supports systemd too
2015-06-09 23:30:31	linux_dream	so... no problem at all?
2015-06-09 23:30:39	Zenther	it is still being developed and I would not consider it stable
2015-06-09 23:30:46	Zenther	it works.... barely
2015-06-09 23:31:01	linux_dream	is it much slower than systemd to boot the machine?
2015-06-09 23:31:04	Zenther	but they want a script only init system
2015-06-09 23:31:22	potmo	oh yay guess what Zenther it auto switched to 318 for me
2015-06-09 23:31:23	arkasizer_	linux_dream, and by barely, some portions are frustrating to get to work.  Also if you forget a useflag you can screw up performance as well
2015-06-09 23:31:45	Zenther	potmo, now, always leave two kernels
2015-06-09 23:31:52	potmo	no grub option necessary I think I spaced through that part but it defaulted to 318
2015-06-09 23:31:56	linux_dream	arkasizer_, ever read about funtoo?

2015-06-09 23:32:18	Zenther	both will get updated until one gets to its end of life, then be looking for a replacement for it so you have 2 again

2015-06-09 23:39:43	Zenther	potmo, imagine #archlinux trying to help you out
2015-06-09 23:40:17	linux_dream	what was the blunder
2015-06-09 23:40:19	arkasizer_	potmo, this is a pretty chill chat
2015-06-09 23:40:34	potmo	Zenther: they have always been nice to me there
2015-06-09 23:40:42	linux_dream	i often ask help in #archlinux but sometimes I'm ignored (nothign bad)

2015-06-09 23:42:07	arkasizer_	potmo, we have this biased opinion because of how they trolled this chat about a year ago
2015-06-09 23:42:16	potmo	and they make me realize just how little I know with their gobbledy gook but they have been patient and fast

2015-06-09 23:43:09	arkasizer_	Zenther, the new zealander is annoying
2015-06-09 23:43:36	potmo	ok well I have had good luck with #arch althogh they did advise against manjaro
2015-06-09 23:43:48	potmo	so that was tipping point and I downloaded the iso
2015-06-09 23:43:56	Zenther	lol
2015-06-09 23:44:05	Zenther	never tell someone not to do something
2015-06-09 23:44:09	potmo	I am being really silly though 
2015-06-09 23:44:12	arkasizer_	potmo, I don't know why they have a problem with manjaro.  mhwd is a solid tool
2015-06-09 23:44:20	potmo	yeah it is
2015-06-09 23:44:29	potmo	they said the updates break
2015-06-09 23:44:46	potmo	and they feel it strays from the "arch way"
2015-06-09 23:44:51	arkasizer_	Never happened to me even once, and I use unstable
2015-06-09 23:45:22	Zenther	tell them even the 'arch way' packages go to testing, manjaro just does it longer than they do
2015-06-09 23:45:41	potmo	no the objection is to all the packages pre-installed I think
2015-06-09 23:45:46	Zenther	but smaller user base, so packages really are not tested that well
2015-06-09 23:46:15	Zenther	90% are going to use them anyway
2015-06-09 23:46:22	potmo	wait im confused
2015-06-09 23:46:25	linux_dream	one critics I've heard in #archlinux is that Phil doesn't know what he's doing and they linked to his repo on github, apparently he removes pacman lock when he shouldn't , or os
2015-06-09 23:46:30	linux_dream	or so *
2015-06-09 23:46:36	potmo	manjaro is smaller user base no?
2015-06-09 23:46:39	Zenther	only real beef is like steam, don't agree with that one myself even though I use it
2015-06-09 23:46:51	potmo	tahts the music player?
2015-06-09 23:46:53	Zenther	yes, manjaro is way smaller user base
2015-06-09 23:47:09	linux_dream	despite what distrowatch says lol
2015-06-09 23:47:09	Zenther	steam is the game community thingy

2015-06-09 23:47:37	Zenther	like xbox live, you can buy games thru steam and play them thru steam
2015-06-09 23:47:39	potmo	yeah they love it
2015-06-09 23:47:53	potmo	linux geeks who are also gaming geeks 
2015-06-09 23:48:02	potmo	which there are one or two of out there heh
2015-06-09 23:48:03	Zenther	but arch way, one should have to manually install steam if you want it
2015-06-09 23:48:15	potmo	right that is what the objection was
2015-06-09 23:48:28	potmo	but it wasn't like the whole channel was chastising or anything
2015-06-09 23:48:57	Zenther	but the flip side is, most everyone wants alsa, pulseaudio, networkmanager, etc, so why the heck not have those?
2015-06-09 23:49:25	potmo	exactly that's what I like about this
2015-06-09 23:49:35	arkasizer_	potmo, Manjaro is built to be accessible to new users and people interested in bleeding edge packages
2015-06-09 23:49:42	potmo	I got so bogged down with bluetooth and netctl-auto not working 
2015-06-09 23:50:12	Zenther	netctl will conflict with networkmanager
2015-06-09 23:50:17	potmo	I have an idea though how about an advanced tab that gives you certain package options during install?
2015-06-09 23:50:35	potmo	yeah it was all foobar I never really sorted it out
2015-06-09 23:50:42	Zenther	there is another installer in the works
2015-06-09 23:50:44	potmo	then I got wicd that seemed ok for a while
2015-06-09 23:50:50	potmo	is that part of the plan?
2015-06-09 23:50:56	potmo	I think that would be a great addition
2015-06-09 23:51:01	linux_dream	I got the famous conflict network manager  -netcl
2015-06-09 23:51:27	potmo	everyone over there does say use network manager not netctl
2015-06-09 23:51:53	potmo	but srsly manjaro is perfect for me so I am very grateful and pleased 
2015-06-09 23:52:04	potmo	now I can open a web browser in linux!
2015-06-09 23:52:19	Zenther	I talked to philm, told him what would be nice is an installer where I pick the de, pick packages out of groups like a video player, a music player, etc and have it customized install that downloads those
2015-06-09 23:52:33	linux_dream	Zenther, a la porteus
2015-06-09 23:52:35	potmo	yeah that's what I would like to see
2015-06-09 23:52:39	linux_dream	you build the iso yourself
2015-06-09 23:52:51	linux_dream	thousands of possibilities 
2015-06-09 23:53:17	potmo	well of course you could just add them one at a time with pacman
2015-06-09 23:53:24	linux_dream	http://build.porteus.org/
2015-06-09 23:53:28	linux_dream	look at that
2015-06-09 23:53:30	Zenther	potmo, there is a windows website that is similar to that that you pick applications you want it custom makes an installer to download and install them
2015-06-09 23:53:44	potmo	yeah I use that
2015-06-09 23:53:48	Zenther	apps like anti-virus, etc
2015-06-09 23:54:00	linux_dream	you pick everything you want, from 64 vs 32 bits, passing by the DE, and then browser, etc.  it builds the ISO based on your choices
2015-06-09 23:54:25	Zenther	no reason for an iso
2015-06-09 23:54:30	potmo	ninite
2015-06-09 23:54:40	potmo	very nice 
2015-06-09 23:54:50	linux_dream	why not, Zenther ?
2015-06-09 23:54:51	Zenther	just need an iso to do the boot, partitioning, package installation
2015-06-09 23:54:59	linux_dream	ah yeah...
2015-06-09 23:55:02	potmo	I try to save everything  of importance to cloud and then I can just fire up all the  apps with a clean install
2015-06-09 23:55:05	linux_dream	but getting a small iso is nice too
2015-06-09 23:55:10	Zenther	let the installer download the latest packages
2015-06-09 23:55:12	linux_dream	porteus basic is about 175 Mb iso
2015-06-09 23:55:25	Zenther	linux_dream, that iso would be out of date in a week
2015-06-09 23:55:42	linux_dream	not sure, it's built at the moment you pick your choices
2015-06-09 23:55:43	Zenther	you download 2x that way
2015-06-09 23:55:46	potmo	oth I kind of regret dling a bunch of new stuff at once because I don't even realize I have it
2015-06-09 23:55:54	linux_dream	the isos aren't pre built
2015-06-09 23:56:07	linux_dream	there are thousands of possible isos, almost a million i think
2015-06-09 23:56:13	linux_dream	due to the choices
2015-06-09 23:56:21	potmo	almost infinite
2015-06-09 23:56:22	linux_dream	so when you download it, it's up to date

2015-06-09 23:56:33	potmo	10000! or something
2015-06-09 23:56:38	Zenther	if you had it build a custom iso, a week later your iso is out of date on the second machine install and would end up downloading all the updates one week later
2015-06-09 23:56:53	linux_dream	not that much I think potmo.  for porteus I mean. for manjaro yeah many more
2015-06-09 23:57:14	potmo	no the installer program asks you the questions unless you choose default install which would be what you are using now
2015-06-09 23:57:55	Zenther	don't put all the packages on the iso, just enough to boot, create an installer, and networking tools, partition tools etc, let it download on install the latest packages for alsa, desktop environment, audio player, video player etc
2015-06-09 23:58:03	potmo	yeah maybe just 100000000
2015-06-09 23:58:09	potmo	10000 squared
2015-06-09 23:58:18	potmo	but probably not 10000 packages
2015-06-09 23:58:19	linux_dream	it's very easy to calculate potmo
2015-06-09 23:58:37	potmo	well you need to know number of packages that you are choosing to either install or not install
2015-06-09 23:58:38	Hairo	dat kde iso

2015-06-09 23:58:45	Hairo	is like 1.8gb
2015-06-09 23:58:56	linux_dream	if you have X choices for the DE, Y choices for the browser,  then you already have X*Y    total possible iso's
2015-06-09 23:59:00	potmo	so it is actually 2^(number of packages to consider I would think)

2015-06-10 00:12:31	Zenther	check you win7 partitions to see if it is or is not

2015-06-10 00:14:04	--	manjpotmo is now known as potmo
2015-06-10 00:14:29	Zenther	you need to see if windows has it's own efi (gpt) partition, if it does use that one for /boot/efi
2015-06-10 00:14:46	Yasaburou	nah it's just one partition
2015-06-10 00:14:50	Zenther	if it does not, then neither is so just do a mbr install
2015-06-10 00:15:26	potmo	what window manager is manjaro using
2015-06-10 00:15:29	Zenther	ya, win7 can be done either way

2015-06-11 23:39:17	mosshorn	Fresh Manjaro install, let's see how this goes :)
2015-06-11 23:40:10	linux_dream	welcome
2015-06-11 23:40:29	onlurking	Batch, even Linux isn't optimized for Gaming xD
2015-06-11 23:40:58	mosshorn	thanks! Was a longtime Crunchbang user, but decided this may be the way to go
2015-06-11 23:41:08	Batch	hehe onlurking 
2015-06-11 23:41:13	Batch	true true
2015-06-11 23:41:25	Batch	steam gonna change that onlurking 
2015-06-11 23:41:46	Batch	about 2000 games will be optimized for steamos for example
2015-06-11 23:41:49	Batch	i think a good start
2015-06-11 23:42:06	onlurking	Linux Kernel isn't low latency by default
2015-06-11 23:42:07	Batch	because of the steam consoles it will be necessary obviously
2015-06-11 23:42:17	onlurking	But theres a patch, Con Kolivas
2015-06-11 23:42:59	potmo	i installed two days ago and am having manjorgasms
2015-06-11 23:43:39	Batch	cool onlurking 
2015-06-11 23:43:43	onlurking	You can achieve extreme performance for gaming, probably the SteamOS use that
2015-06-11 23:43:46	Batch	defenitly something to bookmark
2015-06-11 23:44:07	mosshorn	the biggest issue with linux compatibility in gaming is how fragmented we all are
2015-06-11 23:44:28	onlurking	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gaming
2015-06-11 23:45:19	potmo	there is no time for gaming 
2015-06-11 23:45:27	potmo	linux users have a planet to save
2015-06-11 23:45:41	potmo	save the gaming for those silly proprietary oses
2015-06-11 23:46:19	mosshorn	Civ 5 is native, good enough for me. If League of Legends ever decides to move to us, I'll have little use for Windows anymore
2015-06-11 23:46:24	onlurking	you use proprietary operational systems in VM, your argument is invalid
2015-06-11 23:46:32	potmo	ok so how do i get a terminal window on mac?

2015-06-11 23:47:25	onlurking	i've bought Borderlands 2 GOTY today
2015-06-11 23:47:33	linux_dream	the "free" version of arch is called parabola I've heard
2015-06-11 23:47:38	onlurking	66% off on summer sales :3
2015-06-11 23:47:52	mosshorn	the summer sale is amazing, always is

2015-06-11 23:48:33	mosshorn	But for now I'm just looking at config for this machine. Supped up a Lenovo X220, love this laptop
2015-06-11 23:48:39	onlurking	and RMS use Trisquel 
2015-06-11 23:49:03	potmo	yes but how do i get a terminal window on a mac?
2015-06-11 23:49:16	potmo	isnt this the macjora channel?
2015-06-11 23:49:33	linux_dream	hahaha
2015-06-11 23:49:48	onlurking	Navigate to /Applications/Utilities and doible-click on Terminal.
2015-06-11 23:50:17	onlurking	But, why os x ?
2015-06-11 23:50:46	onlurking	Is a pretty nice system, but is total crapy without the Apple's Hardware
2015-06-11 23:52:45	potmo	for lelz mostly
2015-06-11 23:53:10	onlurking	ah, then it should do the trick :v
2015-06-11 23:53:12	potmo	it is pretty crappy but i was wondering if that was because 4 gigs isnt enough
2015-06-11 23:53:22	potmo	mouse will freeze for a bit and then it will seem fine
2015-06-11 23:54:13	potmo	i have to say i am not overly impressed with the UI
2015-06-11 23:54:23	onlurking	Manjaro has a pretty nice setup eh
2015-06-11 23:54:30	potmo	i really dot need icons bouncing up and down to make me happy
2015-06-11 23:54:43	potmo	manjoro is amazing
2015-06-11 23:55:06	potmo	more user friendly than window without the sluggishness of ubuntu
2015-06-11 23:55:18	onlurking	Pamac is the best thing i've seen in my life
2015-06-11 23:55:28	potmo	taht i wasnt sure about
2015-06-11 23:55:44	potmo	buti did update a couple things when it told me they were available
2015-06-11 23:55:59	onlurking	It's like Synaptic, but, with the Arch AUR
2015-06-11 23:56:06	potmo	i guess pacman seems sufficient to me
2015-06-11 23:56:39	onlurking	Pamac is likely an front for pacman and yaourt
2015-06-11 23:56:48	potmo	yes
2015-06-11 23:56:53	onlurking	Synaptic as a dpkg and apt
2015-06-11 23:57:07	onlurking	But, AUR man, that's awesome
2015-06-11 23:57:12	potmo	yeah 
2015-06-11 23:57:36	Zenther	TAAAAAAANNNK!!!
2015-06-11 23:57:46	potmo	having all the same set up as arch with the archwiki but without having to piec together every element of the desktop from scratch is very nice
2015-06-11 23:58:11	Zenther	Not every arch wiki applies.
2015-06-11 23:58:29	Zenther	but most do if you realize what is different in manjaro
2015-06-11 23:58:54	potmo	well manjoro is superset right but all the arch stuff is here yes?
2015-06-11 23:59:14	Zenther	manjaro kernels are their own as are the graphics drivers
2015-06-11 23:59:56	potmo	but the arch packages are all available 
2015-06-12 00:00:08	Zenther	so don't think you are going to load the nvidia-beta or such from the aur
2015-06-12 00:00:25	onlurking	Currently running: 4.0.4-1-MANJARO (linux40)
2015-06-12 00:00:37	onlurking	Yeah, build's are from Manjaro team
2015-06-12 00:01:52	onlurking	Zenther, you are from the dev team ?
2015-06-12 00:02:14	linux_dream	pamac is bugged man
2015-06-12 00:02:22	linux_dream	i've heard octopi is better
2015-06-12 00:02:41	linux_dream	and doesn't suffer from these stupid "database is locked" messages :)
2015-06-12 00:03:08	potmo	why not just use pacman?
2015-06-12 00:03:18	Zenther	nope, I am not
2015-06-12 00:03:36	Zenther	dev's don't really hang here often at all
2015-06-12 00:03:37	onlurking	I'm running the RC version, no problems here with pamac
2015-06-12 00:03:40	onlurking	not yet
2015-06-12 00:04:03	linux_dream	one day you won't be able to install or remove or get informed about an update due to that bug
2015-06-12 00:04:14	linux_dream	there's a fix though, "fixit" in the terminal
2015-06-12 00:04:31	linux_dream	it's an alias that runs like 3 commnds and one of them is to remove the lock
2015-06-12 00:04:39	mosshorn	I'm just not used to this environment at all, been a Debian child one way or another for 10 years now
2015-06-12 00:04:41	linux_dream	something that pamac should have done
2015-06-12 00:05:40	Zenther	debian was my 'first intro' to linux, total failure, that's back durring the floppy boot days and lilo
2015-06-12 00:05:48	Zenther	although lilo still exists
2015-06-12 00:06:52	linux_dream	lol I can imagine how little ram debian used then
2015-06-12 00:07:08	Zenther	because there wasn't much ram to be used!
2015-06-12 00:07:15	mosshorn	I still like debian, but all I ever hear about is how Arch base is the messiah of Linux
2015-06-12 00:07:42	Zenther	wouldn't say messiah by a long ways
2015-06-12 00:07:59	onlurking	Arch is pure bleeding edge
2015-06-12 00:08:03	Zenther	it is just what an individual is looking for that matters what is a good fit
2015-06-12 00:08:16	Zenther	no way would I put a production server on it
2015-06-12 00:08:17	Zenther	lol
2015-06-12 00:08:34	onlurking	Yeah, that's where Debian comes
2015-06-12 00:08:45	mosshorn	haha true that, maybe the arch revolution is all the Gentoo people in secret
2015-06-12 00:08:47	onlurking	stability and long term support, mostly for servers
2015-06-12 00:08:52	mosshorn	gentoominati
2015-06-12 00:09:05	linux_dream	lol gentoo?  they don't really like systemd
2015-06-12 00:09:09	linux_dream	arch is full of it
2015-06-12 00:09:22	potmo	i thought there were better server distros than debian like fedora and centOS etc
2015-06-12 00:09:40	Zenther	linux_dream, they tolerate systemd more than funtoo!
2015-06-12 00:09:42	potmo	lel gentoominati
2015-06-12 00:09:52	linux_dream	true Zenther 
2015-06-12 00:09:59	linux_dream	it's supported officially at least
2015-06-12 00:10:00	onlurking	I don't know why the Gentoo people didn't invented PKGBUILD before lol
2015-06-12 00:10:00	Zenther	at least it is available on gentoo, not at all on funtoo
2015-06-12 00:10:19	potmo	doesnt sound like much fun this funtoo
2015-06-12 00:10:22	Zenther	they have ebuild
2015-06-12 00:10:24	potmo	dragtoo
2015-06-12 00:10:43	mosshorn	gentoo just makes me uncomfortable, and I blame it fully on their choice of default colors
2015-06-12 00:11:36	onlurking	ebuild is new, isn't ?
2015-06-12 00:11:39	onlurking	never heard of
2015-06-12 00:11:43	Zenther	nope
2015-06-12 00:12:40	Zenther	ebuild files are similar to a pkgbuild file

2015-06-12 00:50:07	Batch	are there shortkeys in sublime text for the tags onlurking ?
2015-06-12 00:50:21	Batch	i mean like autocorrect for tags
2015-06-12 00:50:57	onlurking	https://packagecontrol.io/installation
2015-06-12 00:50:57	Batch	and maybe tab effect for autocorrect
2015-06-12 00:51:32	onlurking	Well, Sublime is pretty simple in the Default installation, when you got the package manager
2015-06-12 00:52:31	onlurking	you can install flake8 in your Linux via pip
2015-06-12 00:53:05	onlurking	and in Sublime, you can install SublimeLinter and SublimeLinter-flake8 for the Linting stuff (view errors in your file)
2015-06-12 00:53:38	onlurking	and "Anaconda" for some IDE capabitilies on Sublime for Python

2015-06-12 01:05:47	onlurking	Every language is a girl language when you put Malboge on the table
2015-06-12 01:05:59	arkasizer	Batch, It's just a myth, especially now with modern c++
2015-06-12 01:06:20	onlurking	C++ is hard
2015-06-12 01:07:03	arkasizer	onlurking, what makes it hard?
2015-06-12 01:07:06	Batch	(. )( .)
2015-06-12 01:07:24	onlurking	templates, meta programming, garbage collecting, pointers, and so on
2015-06-12 01:07:36	arkasizer	onlurking, if you say pointers then you're using c++ wrong
2015-06-12 01:08:09	onlurking	probably
2015-06-12 01:08:37	onlurking	You need to know C++ well to don't use it wrong actually
2015-06-12 01:08:58	arkasizer	or your can use shared or unique ptr
2015-06-12 01:10:04	onlurking	smart pointers eh, i will read about them :D
2015-06-12 01:11:02	arkasizer	I say C++ should be a language of choice because most libraries are written in C/C++.  I know one can write wrappers for other languages, but those wrappers being updated doesn't always happen right away
2015-06-12 01:11:41	onlurking	That's depends on application thought
2015-06-12 01:12:45	onlurking	If you are talking about graphics stuff, operational system things(like services and modules) and audio processing, or something like that you are right
2015-06-12 01:13:33	onlurking	For anything else Python will do the trick :p

2015-06-12 01:15:40	onlurking	looks beautiful*
2015-06-12 01:16:36	arkasizer	There's a lot of other nuances that aggravate me such as people who misuse expressions as defaults for function arguments
2015-06-12 01:17:19	arkasizer	I only see python programmers do this
2015-06-12 01:17:41	arkasizer	Oh and python allows you to modify a list while iterating over it
2015-06-12 01:17:51	arkasizer	Unlike C# which will throw an exception
2015-06-12 01:18:33	Batch	hmm, what could be a nice project to start with as new to programming person?
2015-06-12 01:18:46	Batch	to learn it while doing it
2015-06-12 01:19:13	potmo	seems like it forces people to write good code
2015-06-12 01:19:24	potmo	it was initially meant as educational language
2015-06-12 01:19:32	arkasizer	Oh don't forget to mention that nested functions are worthless because you can't modify variables in the outer scope
2015-06-12 01:19:42	potmo	whatever project the course that is teaching you gives you
2015-06-12 01:20:19	arkasizer	There's too many syntactical flaws in the language itself
2015-06-12 01:21:29	arkasizer	One core aspect of understanding programming is types, and python can't determine between usage or declaration of variables.
2015-06-12 01:22:03	arkasizer	It's rather annoying because nothing in python stops a programmer from overwriting or reusing variables
2015-06-12 01:22:42	arkasizer	Which led to some nasty bugs in my students code prior to the university switching to C++ 3 years ago

2015-06-12 20:31:56	Zenther	Now mozilla is forcing an add-on upon it's users by bundling it hard coded (closed source) into firefox.
2015-06-12 20:32:31	CountryfiedLinux	But add-ons are always optional.
2015-06-12 20:32:37	Zenther	one cannot remove it, only disable it. Who knows what other capabilities are included in this closed source browser add-on

2015-06-12 20:33:00	Zenther	CountryfiedLinux, not any more for Pocket, they added it to firefox
2015-06-12 20:33:36	CountryfiedLinux	No telling what it does, so can't say if it's good or bad without the facts.
2015-06-12 20:33:55	CountryfiedLinux	Otherwise next thing you know I'm smashing my modem with a hammer :P
2015-06-12 20:34:32	Zenther	sounds like something the govt would do. NSA produces a product, forces a company to include it. Keeps it closed source so you cannot see that it is tracking you.
2015-06-12 20:35:10	CountryfiedLinux	Oh BTW Canonical got wiser with their search feature for Unity 8. The user's search info no longer goes through Canonical. In fact the user can see and dictate where everything goes. I'll discuss that in my next episode.
2015-06-12 20:35:28	Zenther	the company (mozilla) just says it is a good tool we were going to implement ourself but decided to just include a free add-on at no cost to you.
2015-06-12 20:35:53	CountryfiedLinux	Disable it if you don't want it right?
2015-06-12 20:36:04	Zenther	who says disabling it does anything
2015-06-12 20:36:11	CountryfiedLinux	It disables it?
2015-06-12 20:36:31	Zenther	ever heard of a switch in a wall that controlled nothing
2015-06-12 20:37:22	CountryfiedLinux	I'd call that a dud switch
2015-06-12 20:37:35	Zenther	there is a setting in about:config, but that isn't good enough. It is and was an add-on. One should be able to remove it. Not just change a setting in about:config that supposedly turns it off.
2015-06-12 20:38:03	CountryfiedLinux	What does it do exactly?
2015-06-12 20:38:06	CountryfiedLinux	the add-on
2015-06-12 20:38:16	Zenther	fucking nothing a bookmark couldn't do
2015-06-12 20:38:18	Zenther	lol
2015-06-12 20:38:33	Zenther	it 'saves' pages you might want to read later
2015-06-12 20:38:58	Zenther	damn, just bookmark it... when you go back later and read it, delete the bookmark
2015-06-12 20:39:00	CountryfiedLinux	I have no use for that.
2015-06-12 20:39:10	CountryfiedLinux	If I wanna read a page later I'll just come back to it later.

2015-06-12 21:34:06	Zenther	most packages come from arch
2015-06-12 21:34:18	Cinnamon811	yes because manjaro is based on arch
2015-06-12 21:34:24	Zenther	kernel, video drivers and tools are manjaro
2015-06-12 21:34:53	Zenther	few others are also custom compiled my manjaro devs
2015-06-12 21:34:54	Cinnamon811	I swithced to manjaro because My arch install broke and i did not want to install it again manually
2015-06-12 21:35:15	Cinnamon811	and because arch has a bug that prevents youfrom playing minecraft
2015-06-12 21:35:18	Zenther	lol - manjaro's best part is a simple gui installer
2015-06-12 21:35:22	Cinnamon811	My kids need to play that
2015-06-12 21:35:50	Zenther	don't understand that game, reminds me of 1990 software
2015-06-12 21:36:06	Cinnamon811	will paman -S yaourt allow me do use the AUR?
2015-06-12 21:36:11	Zenther	but then again, wait long enough and everything comes back in style
2015-06-12 21:36:22	Zenther	you should already have yaourt
2015-06-12 21:36:26	Cinnamon811	ok
2015-06-12 21:36:42	Zenther	unless you did the net install
2015-06-12 21:36:47	Zenther	not sure there
2015-06-12 21:37:26	Cinnamon811	just a recomendation for the devs: you should ad a plymouth theme by default
2015-06-12 21:37:32	Cinnamon811	*add
2015-06-12 21:37:44	Zenther	thought there was one
2015-06-12 21:37:54	Cinnamon811	for me there is not one
2015-06-12 21:37:55	Zenther	I don't like plymouth personally

2015-06-13 14:07:53	+jonathon	there might be more things to fix because you're getting new packages first
2015-06-13 14:08:11	+jonathon	if you're happy using a terminal you'll be fine with the unstable branch
2015-06-13 14:08:31	+jonathon	if you're used to graphical interface or haven't used linux much then stick with stable
2015-06-13 14:08:43	manjaro-kde5	i see, thank you i will stay with stabe for now till kde huge update comes in august. 
2015-06-13 14:09:05	manjaro-kde5	i am comfortable with terminal if there is guide how to do it/
2015-06-13 14:09:18	+jonathon	that's not really what i mean by comfortable
2015-06-13 14:09:32	+jonathon	a guide usually means "copy and paste these commands"
2015-06-13 14:09:33	+jonathon	anyone can do that
2015-06-13 14:09:56	manjaro-kde5	also is it worth upgrading to linux kernel 4.0
2015-06-13 14:10:34	+jonathon	that depends on a lot of things
2015-06-13 14:10:41	manjaro-kde5	jonathon: of course not!

2015-06-13 14:12:03	manjaro-kde5	to be honest i find manjaro unstable safe  more than ubuntu unstable.

2015-06-13 17:03:49	@ringo32	arch wiki but luks is more usefull on places where it needs
2015-06-13 17:03:59	@ringo32	thats my opinion , so like /home
2015-06-13 17:04:12	@ringo32	there is place general you work on
2015-06-13 17:04:15	thunderwillow	I just though that alot of config files where sotred on /
2015-06-13 17:04:20	thunderwillow	*stored
2015-06-13 17:05:03	thunderwillow	all kernel files are stored in /sys I believe
2015-06-13 17:05:17	@ringo32	configs of theming like that is stored in hidden map like /home/thunderwillow/.config
2015-06-13 17:05:27	@ringo32	or in .local
2015-06-13 17:05:38	thunderwillow	but what about files not stored in /home
2015-06-13 17:05:46	thunderwillow	like /sys or /var
2015-06-13 17:05:51	thunderwillow	or swap
2015-06-13 17:08:37	@ringo32	swap is just a swap space  in Var are package cache or informartion about xorg or system logs
2015-06-13 17:08:41	sQVe	ringo32, havent figured out an genius solution? :P
2015-06-13 17:08:43	@ringo32	not privatly

2015-06-13 17:09:33	thunderwillow	I just though if system logs where exposed then anyone could see what command have been executed etc
2015-06-13 17:09:49	sQVe	So your saying I should update nvidia drivers?

2015-06-15 11:19:30	Zenther	Nixola, and how much did you reinstall? and did you reboot or restart pulse?
2015-06-15 11:19:39	Nixola	what do you mean, output for my sound card
2015-06-15 11:19:49	Nixola	I reinstalled any package that contained "pulse" or "alsa"
2015-06-15 11:19:53	Nixola	and no, I fear I did not restart pulse
2015-06-15 11:20:00	Nixola	should I stop it, reinstall everything and restart it?
2015-06-15 11:20:03	Zenther	well need to
2015-06-15 11:20:21	Nixola	how do I stop it?
2015-06-15 11:20:23	Zenther	need to get it restarted

2015-06-15 11:22:49	Zenther	pulseaudio --kill then pulseaudio --start might have done it but rebooting makes sure the handshakes and also get done too...
2015-06-15 11:23:14	Zenther	ok, 2nd time... lol
2015-06-15 11:23:50	Zenther	Nixola, what packages btw had the work manjaro in them?
2015-06-15 11:23:57	Nixola	two of them
2015-06-15 11:24:20	Nixola	manjaro-alsa and manjaro-pulse

2015-06-15 11:24:55	Zenther	which one fixed it? not sure, just do them all... lol
2015-06-15 11:25:39	Zenther	I think it is pulseaudio-alsa by suspicion as it contains the etc/asound.conf file
2015-06-15 11:26:12	Nixola	I reinstalled anything that had either alsa or pulse
2015-06-15 11:26:19	Nixola	like a dozen packages
2015-06-15 11:26:24	Zenther	yay, just checked after reboot, delete key working again... that was wierd
2015-06-15 11:27:13	Zenther	middle mouse button paste working again too!
2015-06-15 11:27:22	Batch	Zenther, what caused it?
2015-06-15 11:27:32	Zenther	wonder why those happened to break so shortly after a boot
2015-06-15 11:27:46	Zenther	Batch, don't know.... reboot fixed it though
2015-06-15 11:28:05	Batch	i had similar issue couple days ago

2015-06-15 11:29:21	Nixola	other issue! related to the USB speaker
2015-06-15 11:31:13	Nixola	setting its output to 97% almost nullifies i
2015-06-15 11:31:14	Nixola	it*
2015-06-15 11:31:36	Nixola	it's as its volume range is 96.5-100% instead of 0-100%
2015-06-15 11:31:41	Nixola	builtin speakers work fine
2015-06-15 11:31:50	Reepicheep	Zenther: thanks,  I recently switched to a new client and I bet it auto joins before it gets my "Unafiliated" mask applied
2015-06-15 11:32:01	Bagga	Nixola: I've had that problem... don't remember what I did
2015-06-15 11:32:04	Zenther	redeemed, yup
2015-06-15 11:32:24	Zenther	sasl is easiest fix, other is set a delay script before autojoin
2015-06-15 11:32:25	Nixola	I think I've got a friend who maybe can help me
2015-06-15 11:32:35	Bagga	Nixola: what soundcard/laptop are you using?
2015-06-15 11:32:46	Nixola	Bagga: I have no clue at all, it's an Asus laptop
2015-06-15 11:33:37	Bagga	Nixola: all I remember is I had to do some hardcore stuff to get that fixed... it seemed persistent on reboot as well
2015-06-15 11:33:40	Nixola	alsa woks fine though
2015-06-15 11:33:48	Nixola	I can control its volume finely with alsa
2015-06-15 11:33:57	Bagga	ah ok
2015-06-15 11:34:01	Bagga	then it's not the same problem :P

2015-06-15 21:47:12	linux_dream	maybe linux from scratch is. gentoo comes with portage/emerge
2015-06-15 21:47:26	thenewone	ok 
2015-06-15 21:47:31	thenewone	i should give it a try 
2015-06-15 21:47:40	linux_dream	try it in a vm first, that-s what i did
2015-06-15 21:47:47	thenewone	yep 
2015-06-15 21:47:56	linux_dream	and just follow the wiki and in doubt ask in #gentoo
2015-06-15 21:48:26	thenewone	ok 
2015-06-15 21:48:34	thenewone	thanks for infos 
2015-06-15 21:48:36	linux_dream	in gentoo openrc is the default init system.  youve got to choose systemd during the installation process if you want to use systemd
2015-06-15 21:48:52	linux_dream	but in a vm i guess you dont really care
2015-06-15 21:48:55	thenewone	that's nice 
2015-06-15 21:48:59	thenewone	ofc :)

2015-06-15 22:50:45	shndns	You need to pay attention to what your doing when using hte AUR

2015-06-15 22:51:44	zardock	You can damage your system if dont now havet ou used
2015-06-15 22:52:05	linux_dream	sometimes packages break in the aur
2015-06-15 22:52:13	linux_dream	you may have to learn how to downgrade 
2015-06-15 22:52:22	shndns	sometimes they aren't maintained and they are extremely old.
2015-06-15 22:52:29	linux_dream	manjaro comes with downgrader I think by default , a program to downgrade
2015-06-15 22:52:41	linux_dream	rstudio got broken recently
2015-06-15 22:52:49	linux_dream	a program i got in the aur
2015-06-15 22:52:59	linux_dream	cower too
2015-06-15 22:53:18	linux_dream	well cower didnt break , just not updated to the new aur4
2015-06-15 22:53:55	zardock	YEAP
2015-06-15 22:53:55	shndns	I recommend looking up the specific package in the AUR database before installing. This way you can see what other people are saying and you can see when the last time it was updated.
2015-06-15 22:54:02	zardock	CAN BREAK YOUR SYSTEM
2015-06-15 22:54:35	shndns	I've never had anything from the AUR break my system as a whole, but I've had individual packages break others.
2015-06-15 22:55:00	zardock	but you can reopair break packages

2015-06-16 11:23:41	+Jolt2bolt	is more or less freedom
2015-06-16 11:23:47	Manj-811-Xfce2	I don't know how wine works but this made me really confused.. how can windows software work on linux
2015-06-16 11:23:50	Manj-811-Xfce2	strange
2015-06-16 11:23:55	thenewone	free dont mean gratis it's mean ( you are free to do what you want with it )
2015-06-16 11:24:04	LucaB	Manj-811-Xfce2: google helps
2015-06-16 11:24:12	Manj-811-Xfce2	thenewone I agree
2015-06-16 11:24:17	peetaur2	Manj-811-Xfce2: linux is a kernel and userland; windows too; wine reimplements the windows libraries in the userland required to run windows apps
2015-06-16 11:24:29	Manj-811-Xfce2	you can change linux, make a new linux and distribute it
2015-06-16 11:24:36	Manj-811-Xfce2	whatever you wanna do with it
2015-06-16 11:24:38	thenewone	yep 
2015-06-16 11:24:42	peetaur2	Manj-811-Xfce2: just like cygwin also does not emulate linux, but ports the software to windows
2015-06-16 11:24:48	+Jolt2bolt	WINE is not an emulator, is more like a layer of compatibility that say the windows programs where to find what they need to work 
2015-06-16 11:24:59	+Jolt2bolt	like a tour guide, for example
2015-06-16 11:25:06	thenewone	^
2015-06-16 11:25:07	peetaur2	(reimplement is to write new code, but port is to just modify the code... windows is closed source so the freedom to modify the code was not there)
2015-06-16 11:25:15	LucaB	Jolt2bolt: but it's is easier for noobs to understand if you say emulator
2015-06-16 11:25:25	+Jolt2bolt	but is not
2015-06-16 11:25:38	+Jolt2bolt	an emulator do all like the system intended to do
2015-06-16 11:25:40	Manj-811-Xfce2	does it changes the compiled code of windows software into linux-familiar code
2015-06-16 11:25:41	peetaur2	if M$ ever goes bankrupt *crosses fingers* then they'll probably open the code and you'll see it ported to wine
2015-06-16 11:25:59	x0g	I tried playing WoW 3-4 years ago on Debian and it was a bit buggy so I always keep Windows in dualboot for CAD and games. Lately I only play PSX and NES games tbh
2015-06-16 11:26:06	zaggynl	I'd rather see they go open source before going bankrupt
2015-06-16 11:26:10	+Jolt2bolt	while a compatibility layer just help the program to reconize how to search the tools like a tour guide
2015-06-16 11:26:31	thenewone	x0g, wow 5.4.7 works fine for me 
2015-06-16 11:27:04	Manj-811-Xfce2	zaggynl, windows won't go bankrupt, they have a big market
2015-06-16 11:27:05	x0g	thenewone last version I really played was 3.3.5a. Cata killed my will to play :)
2015-06-16 11:27:11	peetaur2	zaggynl: yeah I guess I meant if they risk bankruptcy
2015-06-16 11:27:29	thenewone	x0g, i understand you specialy if you play warrior 
2015-06-16 11:27:35	+Jolt2bolt	NO manj-811-Xfce2, is not like it change you, just help it like a tour guide in a forgein country how to act and do the things they want but with the rules of that os
2015-06-16 11:27:37	thenewone	i want kill my self 
2015-06-16 11:27:40	Manj-811-Xfce2	but here in Pakistan, anyone can buy a DVD of pirated version of any windows for 50 cents
2015-06-16 11:27:51	peetaur2	but before they go open source, they have to remove the backdoors so nobody will know they were there.. and they need either (1) money, which a company at risk doesn't have or (2) bankruptcy so nobody can be fined/prosecuted if they are caught :D
2015-06-16 11:28:04	thenewone	mist of pandaria make noobs in pvp looks like pros :D
2015-06-16 11:28:06	peetaur2	(1) to fund removing the backdoors
2015-06-16 11:28:15	x0g	thenewone main was mage and mages were strong but gameplay was not fun for me anymore
2015-06-16 11:28:27	+Jolt2bolt	lol
2015-06-16 11:28:31	thenewone	i hate mages :D

2015-06-16 11:39:12	peetaur2	jonathon: so they should have a distributed system, with 3rd parties hosting it, and anonymous login to download the games so they don't have power to disable it for anyone
2015-06-16 11:39:37	peetaur2	or even just torrent them and have a license registered somewhere to make it legal
2015-06-16 11:39:50	+Jolt2bolt	I love the way that resident evil has limited ammo
2015-06-16 11:40:09	+jonathon	who controls the license server?
2015-06-16 11:40:35	peetaur2	jonathon: the guys that already have your money, and don't care if you're happy with the service :D
2015-06-16 11:40:47	peetaur2	and wrote in the license agreement that they can terminate you for any reason
2015-06-16 11:41:07	+jonathon	eh, no you said "have a license registered somewhere to make it legal"
2015-06-16 11:41:14	+jonathon	who controls that?
2015-06-16 11:41:40	peetaur2	just the same as you'd have with a boxed game.. just some recipt or whatever somewhere, if not a box
2015-06-16 11:41:53	peetaur2	maybe base it on cryptocoin ;)
2015-06-16 11:42:35	+jonathon	i think you hit on something there
2015-06-16 11:42:40	+jonathon	blockchain licensing
2015-06-16 11:42:44	+jonathon	proof of ownership
2015-06-16 11:42:51	+jonathon	what an idea
2015-06-16 11:42:58	peetaur2	almost anything related to information can go in cryptocoin
2015-06-16 11:43:00	 *	jonathon scurries off to see if it's already been done

2015-06-16 23:20:50	arkasizer	CountryfiedLinux, I'd just do a net install
2015-06-16 23:21:09	CountryfiedLinux	That takes too long arkasizer :P
2015-06-16 23:21:23	CountryfiedLinux	too many steps
2015-06-16 23:21:33	CountryfiedLinux	Not too many steps but too time consuming
2015-06-16 23:21:39	arkasizer	Well it would take just about the same amount of time
2015-06-16 23:21:43	CountryfiedLinux	And I trust the regular installing more.
2015-06-16 23:21:56	arkasizer	Infact probably less because you have to remove xfce first then install cinnamon
2015-06-16 23:22:17	CountryfiedLinux	Removing everything doesn't take but a few minutes actually.
2015-06-16 23:22:57	CountryfiedLinux	about a minute
2015-06-16 23:24:19	arkasizer	So add a minute to the net install time :)

2015-06-17 20:42:47	arkasizer	Windows 8.1 is very nice, speedy, and memory efficient.
2015-06-17 20:43:07	grunhart	Still isn't great for gaming.
2015-06-17 20:43:10	grunhart	Sadly.
2015-06-17 20:44:59	arkasizer	Works better for me actually, I'm getting smoother frames in Unreal Engine 4
2015-06-17 20:45:14	arkasizer	I never thought I would say that

2015-06-17 21:05:45	kuenx	Hi. I'm trying to install Manjaro with the graphical installer. I want to use LUKS + LVM the same way the automatic partitioning does it. But automatic partitioning always creates a 30G partition for / and the rest for /home. I want my / partition to be 100G. Using manual partitioning I couldn't figure out how to set it up. Could somebody give me a hint?

2015-06-17 21:11:51	oberon	kuenex you can create the partitions before installation
2015-06-17 21:11:59	oberon	use gparted
2015-06-17 21:12:10	oberon	then you simply select the partitions for mouning
2015-06-17 21:12:17	oberon	mounting*
2015-06-17 21:12:35	oberon	just, why would you want such a huge / partition?
2015-06-17 21:12:40	oberon	;)
2015-06-17 21:12:53	grunhart	Steam?
2015-06-17 21:13:11	oberon	anyway. just partition beforehand and then choose the mountpoints
2015-06-17 21:13:17	oberon	shouldn't be a problem
2015-06-17 21:13:55	kuenx	oberon: I want to install a lot of applications. Also things like Docker images use a lot of space.
2015-06-17 21:14:07	oberon	yeah, no problem! :)
2015-06-17 21:14:50	kuenx	oberon: If I create the partitions using Gparted beforehand, how do I make tham use LUKS and LVM?
2015-06-17 21:15:18	kuenx	or how does the automatic installer do it? Is it LUKS on LVM or LVM on LUKS?

2015-06-17 21:17:52	oberon	luks is just the encryption
2015-06-17 21:18:04	oberon	the volumes have to exist first
2015-06-17 21:18:28	oberon	but now that i think of it, i'm not so sure if gparted supports lvm ...
2015-06-17 21:19:14	oberon	why can't you change the partition size in the installer?
2015-06-17 21:19:15	kuenx	oberon: Is it better if I use LUKS without LVM? 
2015-06-17 21:20:06	kuenx	The installer doesn't allow to tweak the partition sizes when using automatic partitioning

2015-06-17 21:22:11	oberon	no. you have to do it manually
2015-06-17 21:22:26	oberon	two ideas
2015-06-17 21:22:57	oberon	1. if you choose lvm you will easily be able to grow the partition later
2015-06-17 21:23:06	oberon	that's the advantage of lvm

2015-06-17 21:23:25	oberon	personally i'm not such a fan of lvm ;) 
2015-06-17 21:23:39	oberon	or you use the manual partitioning option
2015-06-17 21:23:45	oberon	and do encryption only
2015-06-17 21:24:02	oberon	there you can set the partition size immediately
2015-06-17 21:24:20	oberon	what is your reason for wanting to use lvm?
2015-06-17 21:24:47	kuenx	oberon: I might go for the second option. If want both / and /home encrypted I just enter the same password for both of them?
2015-06-17 21:24:59	oberon	also: if you have a separate /home partition it will be really easy to do a new install with different settings and partitions
2015-06-17 21:25:27	oberon	you can then simply move your home partition and mount it with whatever installation ...
2015-06-17 21:26:08	oberon	yeah, don't make it too complicated with different passwords ;)
2015-06-17 21:26:12	kuenx	do I have to encrypt swap too?
2015-06-17 21:26:34	oberon	no
2015-06-17 21:26:46	oberon	i wouldn't say so
2015-06-17 21:27:16	oberon	what size is your ram?

2015-06-17 21:30:22	oberon	but if you have enough diskspace available why not
2015-06-17 21:30:33	kuenx	I have 500G SSD
2015-06-17 21:31:25	kuenx	The installer just complained that it couldn't format my LUKS partition with ext4
2015-06-17 21:31:52	oberon	4GB swap will be enough
2015-06-17 21:32:10	oberon	which one?

2015-06-17 21:32:49	kuenx	both home and root
2015-06-17 21:33:55	kuenx	Does it make a fifference whether I use MBR or GPT for the partition table?
2015-06-17 21:34:00	kuenx	*difference
2015-06-17 21:34:35	kuenx	I chose GPT because it said "msdos" next to MBR
2015-06-17 21:35:17	oberon	try mbr

2015-06-18 12:03:49	peetaur2	and if he has EFI, he needs an EFI FAT32 (vfat) partition instead maybe

2015-06-18 12:04:11	IanLD	Ok, EFI is new to me, so how can I check that.
2015-06-18 12:04:19	peetaur2	look up the motherboard online

2015-06-18 12:05:34	peetaur2	you could also go to the 'bios' (firmware) and see if there is an option in boot for "efi shell", which means it's efi
2015-06-18 12:06:04	IanLD	Checking bios
2015-06-18 12:06:11	tumbler	Nixola: however i am using Arch now and i see the same module for my keyboard ... i think is the common useless
2015-06-18 12:06:43	Nixola	so I see you took that hypotetical advice

2015-06-18 12:12:07	peetaur2	okay then for sure, the proper thing to do is make a bios_grub

2015-06-18 12:12:32	peetaur2	but no guarantee that without it, you'd notice problems (but yes guaranteed if you had more complexity with mdadm, lvm, etc.)

2015-06-21 02:44:03	CountryfiedLinux	ringo32, but might be a good idea :)
2015-06-21 02:44:12	+ringo32	you need to copy your own map

2015-06-21 02:45:15	CountryfiedLinux	Don't hidden files automatically copy?
2015-06-21 02:45:30	CountryfiedLinux	Might as well unhide them and do it all at once.
2015-06-21 02:47:09	shndns	Well
2015-06-21 02:47:25	ggr	when you use the right command for copy, all files will get copied
2015-06-21 02:47:57	ggr	for example rsync -ahvz --progress
2015-06-21 02:48:14	+ringo32	first unhide , copy you map
2015-06-21 02:48:26	+ringo32	 then use that copied file as source

2015-06-21 03:22:40	CountryfiedLinux	Systemd is reliable, backwards compatible, faster...
2015-06-21 03:23:19	CountryfiedLinux	My friend Utkarsh is the lead developer of Rebellin Linux and he prefers Systemd. Many other distro developers do too. It must have something right.
2015-06-21 03:24:01	newname	There is some concern about its lack of documentation
2015-06-21 03:24:31	ggr	there's much criticism of systemd.. for one, it's far beyond an init system now, and it's getting worse.. for me personally, i never got swap to work properly, i suspect because of systemd.. on an openrc installation that i have, swap works just fine
2015-06-21 03:25:22	CountryfiedLinux	But 32 bit processors are still supported today ringo32 
2015-06-21 03:26:16	CountryfiedLinux	I imagine developers use the best tool for the job. If something is better than Systemd it should have no problem catching on.

2015-06-22 00:26:38	coolthingu500	You should try Manjaro first, and then Arch. To be frank, you might not be able to tell the difference.
2015-06-22 00:27:26	coolthingu500	Arch with some execption, isn't the fastest, nor easist to set up If you are getting started.

2015-06-22 06:15:13	Nixola	hi, if I have a .deb (or .rpm or slp or lsb or tgz) package, can I reliably convert it to .tar.xz to install it with Pacman?
2015-06-22 06:15:42	Nixola	otherwise, what would happen if I installed it with dpkg if I am sure its file won't conflict with anything?
2015-06-22 06:15:45	Nixola	files*
2015-06-22 06:16:09	+Strit_Laptop	Nixola, does the software not have an AUR package?
2015-06-22 06:16:19	Nixola	Strit_Laptop: yes, but it fails to build
2015-06-22 06:16:30	+Strit_Laptop	What error?
2015-06-22 06:16:35	peetaur2	Nixola: the pacman tar.xz has some metadata files inside too, which the foreign package won't
2015-06-22 06:16:40	Nixola	lots of errors
2015-06-22 06:16:47	peetaur2	Nixola: why not get it from AUR where you'll find nearly anything?
2015-06-22 06:16:55	Nixola	peetaur2: don't the other packages have other types of metadata?
2015-06-22 06:16:56	+Strit_Laptop	My bet is, that the AUR packages uses the .deb as a source.
2015-06-22 06:17:07	Nixola	Strit_Laptop: no, the aur package builds from source
2015-06-22 06:17:30	+Strit_Laptop	Well, best is to find a solution to those errors then.
2015-06-22 06:17:33	Nixola	it's something about an inline function declared but not specified or something
2015-06-22 06:18:04	peetaur2	Nixola: yes but usually the conversion utilities (alien, rpm2cpio, etc.) don't really convert everything... just repack it without understanding what is inside
2015-06-22 06:18:08	+Strit_Laptop	Nixola, does the AUR page for the package say anything about it in the comments?
2015-06-22 06:18:17	Nixola	Strit_Laptop: no
2015-06-22 06:18:40	Nixola	peetaur2: so ignoring metadata?
2015-06-22 06:18:48	+Strit_Laptop	Nixola, should not be a problem with the package then, more likely you are missing something on your system.
2015-06-22 06:18:49	peetaur2	Strit_Laptop: the AUR packages have their own PKGBUILD and don't use any other distro stuff to build them... and yaourt auto-compiles it for you; it is not installing binary debs for example
2015-06-22 06:19:04	peetaur2	Nixola: not totally sure what alien does, but rpm2cpio surely removes the metadata and keeps only files

2015-06-22 06:31:20	peetaur2	in programming, inline is something the compiler optimizer does... instead of building a new stack, return address, etc. for a function, it is more like it just copies & pastes the function into where you called it, so it's more efficient

2015-06-22 06:54:16	peetaur2	but a package that installs should not also install files in user homes
2015-06-22 06:55:21	peetaur2	for the "fails if the file isn't there", you might have to just manually do the gneerate or copy (eg. with shorewall you cp /usr/share/shorewall/configfiles/* /etc/shorewall; rm /etc/shorewall/*.annotated)

2015-06-22 07:01:22	peetaur2	with alsa, you may have to manually modify the alsa config.   aplay -l lists devices, then write the device in the config
2015-06-22 07:01:32	Nixola	good enough
2015-06-22 07:01:35	peetaur2	and multi-device support is actually probably the only non-imaginary problem solved by pulse heh
2015-06-22 07:01:54	Nixola	I don't need multi-device support, I only want that external speaker
2015-06-22 07:01:56	Nixola	builtin sucks
2015-06-22 07:02:05	peetaur2	interestingly, I seem to have no alsa config file at the office :D but sound works.... (at home I have such a file, and also a usb stick like you, which meant I modified that file)
2015-06-22 07:02:20	peetaur2	also you can just blacklist the other audio device if you want, and then the other will always be device 0
2015-06-22 07:02:32	Nixola	so what do I have to do to get alsa working, besides uninstalling pulse?

2015-06-22 07:03:37	Nixola	you're really helping me a lot
2015-06-22 07:04:01	peetaur2	I don't think I see a full dmix+duplex config in that page though... the one I use at home is not similar at all
2015-06-22 07:04:34	peetaur2	they have it, but not in one generic config you can paste ... it's spread around
2015-06-22 07:04:57	peetaur2	but see the   pcm "hw:0,0"   stuff? that's where the aplay -l number goes to select a device
2015-06-22 07:05:49	Nixola	what is OSS?

2015-06-22 07:06:48	peetaur2	something old and deprecatedish
2015-06-22 07:07:07	peetaur2	it has a real purpose, and works together with alsa ... but development effort has gone stale
2015-06-22 07:07:31	peetaur2	but I'm not sure why you need OSS... people that like it say they have more direct control than what they get with alsa

2015-06-22 07:08:19	peetaur2	(but no idea which package aoss is in on manjaro)
2015-06-22 07:09:09	peetaur2	(and there's a similar thing for pulse... apulse, which emulates pulse in alsa, but you have to compile it for only either 32 bit or 64 bit, not both...)
2015-06-22 07:12:12	Nixola	good, edited /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf and now it works

2015-06-22 07:15:19	peetaur2	you edited it in /usr/share? not in /etc ?
2015-06-22 07:15:31	peetaur2	the name is supposed to be something like /etc/asound.conf
2015-06-22 07:16:01	peetaur2	oh that file is huge... maybe that's where my asound.conf is at the office
2015-06-22 07:17:03	Nixola	I have no /etc/asound.conf anymore
2015-06-22 07:17:09	Nixola	I think it got removed with pulse
2015-06-22 07:17:37	Nixola	can I set the device by its name instead of using numbers?
2015-06-22 07:18:19	Nixola	my card 0, the builtin speakers, is named PCH while the usb speaker is named CD002
2015-06-22 07:19:13	peetaur2	I only know how to set numbers
2015-06-22 07:19:18	peetaur2	maybe there's a way, but I don't know it
2015-06-22 07:19:37	peetaur2	so I just blacklisted my sound (with pci-stub rather than actual blacklist) and then my usb one is always 0
2015-06-22 07:20:20	peetaur2	without that, my usb would be 1 if I left my onboard sound enabled, otherwise it would be 0 (when I give my onboard to vfio-pci to give to a virtual machine) ... so static 0 is better
2015-06-22 07:20:38	Nixola	pci-stub?
2015-06-22 07:21:09	peetaur2	pci-stub is a dummy driver you can attach to pci devices to prevent the regular driver from using it... so for example I can have 2 radeon devices with one with pci-stub and the other on radeon
2015-06-22 07:21:25	peetaur2	with blacklist, I'd have no radeon... without, I'd have 2. So pci-stub lets me have 1/2 of the same card
2015-06-22 07:22:11	Nixola	I could blacklist it though, I think they're different enough
2015-06-22 07:22:20	peetaur2	I found that my linux didn't like my onboard sound very much, so I gave linux the usb stick, and windows the onboard
2015-06-22 07:23:00	peetaur2	(that is running simultaneously... windows in a virtual machine, with its own usb ports, sound card, video card)

2015-06-22 07:24:52	Nixola	peetaur2: how do I attach pci-stub to a card?
2015-06-22 07:24:59	peetaur2	on boot or manually?
2015-06-22 07:25:17	Nixola	both?
2015-06-22 07:25:46	peetaur2	okay, on boot you add to kernel cmdline, things like:      pci-stub.ids=1002:679a,1002:aaa0
2015-06-22 07:25:51	peetaur2	get those ids from   lspci -nn
2015-06-22 07:26:34	peetaur2	and if you built pci-stub in the kernel like me, it works. If not, you have to add pci-stub to the modules list in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf and rebuild the cpio
2015-06-22 07:26:52	Nixola	by kernel cmdline you mean something in GRUB right?
2015-06-22 07:27:12	peetaur2	yes
2015-06-22 07:28:23	Nixola	so I should get the id from the audio controller line
2015-06-22 07:29:24	peetaur2	and to do it manually vis sysfs... it depends on driver, but usually just:   lspci -k to find driver, then lspci -D   then the left bit of that goes here;     echo "0000:00:10.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/snd_hda_intel/unbind; echo "0000:00:10.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind   or something similar
2015-06-22 07:29:45	peetaur2	my notes for that are at home ... and they deleted my page I made about it on xen so I can't refer to it here   http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Talk:Bind_lib.bash_:_A_script_that_makes_pciback_with_modules_easier_to_use
2015-06-22 07:29:47	peetaur2	and I use kvm now, not xen
2015-06-22 07:29:52	Nixola	on boot looks better
2015-06-22 07:30:09	peetaur2	oh here it is http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Bind_lib.bash
2015-06-22 07:30:43	peetaur2	with my script there, you just do     bindstub "0000:00:10.0"   for example, and it does it all
2015-06-22 07:31:06	peetaur2	(and with kvm, you don't use pci-stub except at boot... you also should do a thing like this bind_lib but using vfio-pci)

2015-06-22 07:31:50	Nixola	where do I add the kernel parameter? I should not edit grub.cfg directly, should I?
2015-06-22 07:31:51	peetaur2	and according to my bind lib script, there is more than unbind+bind ... there's some "new_id" thing (which you possibly don't need if you aren't passing it through... and if you passthrough, you should use vfio anyway, not pci-stub nowadays)
2015-06-22 07:32:01	peetaur2	add in /etc/default/grub maybe...
2015-06-22 07:32:13	peetaur2	or what I do is make a file in /etc/grub.d/ that prints the custom entries
2015-06-22 07:32:33	peetaur2	update-grub runs those scripts to generate the entries
2015-06-22 07:34:09	Nixola	I added it to /etc/default/grub, rebooting to test it
2015-06-22 07:34:19	Nixola	I should edit the alsa conf file again before though
2015-06-22 07:34:29	Nixola	I don't think I'll have again a card number 1

2015-06-22 07:41:50	peetaur2	not sure... I guess :)
2015-06-22 07:42:06	peetaur2	find the filename with     find /lib/modules -name "*pci-stub*"
2015-06-22 07:42:13	peetaur2	for example    kernel/drivers/pci/pci-stub.ko.gz
2015-06-22 07:42:17	peetaur2	so I guess it's just pci-stub

2015-06-22 09:02:09	Nixola	hi again
2015-06-22 09:02:18	Nixola	peetaur2: are you by chance still here?
2015-06-22 09:02:48	peetaur2	Nixola: yes
2015-06-22 09:03:01	peetaur2	Nixola: to test to see that the module is there, look inside the cpio file
2015-06-22 09:03:10	Nixola	cpio?
2015-06-22 09:04:52	peetaur2	mkdir /tmp/cpiotest; cd /tmp/cpiotest; gunzip -c /boot/initramfs-[...].img | cpio -iv; find . -name "pci-stub*"    maybe
2015-06-22 09:05:06	peetaur2	cpio is a type of archive, but simpler, uglier, and more mysterious :)
2015-06-22 09:05:25	peetaur2	it is used because then grub doesn't need support for more complicated formats I guess
2015-06-22 09:07:35	Nixola	yes, it's there
2015-06-22 09:07:44	Nixola	also lsmod | grep pci shows pci_stub
2015-06-22 09:10:55	peetaur2	and when you boot, do you see that the cmdline is right? (cat /proc/cmdline) or that the card is bound to pci-stub? (lspci -k)
2015-06-22 09:11:52	Nixola	no, the cmdline isn't right
2015-06-22 09:12:28	peetaur2	then that may be why it doesn't work ;)

2015-06-22 09:13:58	peetaur2	hehe yes ...
2015-06-22 09:14:01	peetaur2	update-grub
2015-06-22 09:14:12	peetaur2	then verify that the line you want is in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2015-06-22 09:14:13	Nixola	I never did, because I never cared about anything and just edited /boot/grub/grub.cfg before
2015-06-22 09:14:26	peetaur2	ah well...
2015-06-22 09:14:36	peetaur2	then you should also cpy your other manual edits to the right place, or update-grub overwrites them
2015-06-22 09:14:50	peetaur2	and you should avoid directly editing it... any "pacman -Su" might end up running update-grub automatically
2015-06-22 09:15:36	Nixola	I know

2015-06-22 09:20:40	peetaur2	we just made sure no driver ever ends up on your other device
2015-06-22 09:20:46	Nixola	yes
2015-06-22 09:20:55	Nixola	he point is, when I plug it back I still get no sound

2015-06-22 09:21:11	peetaur2	you mean works, unplug plug back in, no sound? well that's something else
2015-06-22 09:21:37	peetaur2	unless it's a usb device ... in which case the program has to open it again, because the device was removed, not just the speaker
2015-06-22 09:21:55	Nixola	after I unplug and plug it back mpg123 segfaults
2015-06-22 09:22:14	peetaur2	heh
2015-06-22 09:22:37	peetaur2	is it usb?
2015-06-22 09:22:43	Nixola	yup
2015-06-22 09:22:44	peetaur2	do you disconnect the usb port?
2015-06-22 09:23:14	peetaur2	if you disconnect the audio controller from the computer, the whole device goes away ... if you disconnect just the speaker from the audio controller, it shouldn't do that
2015-06-22 09:23:32	peetaur2	(and also, segfault is always a programming error... it is not normal even if you unplug hardware)

2015-06-22 12:11:58	peetaur2	creep: sounds like a mode setting issue (unless you customized the X11 conf and broke it ... check that later). As a workaround, you can add "nomodeset" to the kernel cmdline (which ends up in the grub.cfg by using /etc/default/grub and update-grub).
2015-06-22 12:12:28	peetaur2	creep: you can hit ctrl+alt+f1 to get a text tty, which might work even with X broken like that

2015-06-22 12:14:11	creep	i made a live cd and from there it is not possible to install manajro... i have tried this cd in an newer notebook and it works there. so live cd is ok... when i boot up with manajaro live cd i get into the menu

2015-06-22 22:11:47	johnny_	Hello new Manjaro user here. I like how responsive it it! Question: Is there a way to disable the 'popping' sound when I adjust the volume wheel on my notebook? I find it rather annoying honestly.
2015-06-22 22:11:48	ediT	:O
2015-06-22 22:11:52	xTomyLEE	maybe google translater more correctly to dutch

2015-06-22 22:27:08	johnny_	Just in case I'm not being clear, A) there's nothing wrong with the sound other than B) an annoying sound effect that is intentionally making a series of 'popping' sounds that let you guage your current sound settings. I've found in other distros I can merely r-click over the speaker icon in the panel, choose the sound effects tab, and disable this behavior. the panel icon here doesn't offer to let me change anything via a 'Sound 
2015-06-22 22:27:08	johnny_	Application'. Am I doing something wrong?
2015-06-22 22:27:37	johnny_	>your current volume settings*

2015-06-22 22:28:36	johnny_	I'd happily adjust it via the console then, but I haven't a clue where to even begin. :/

2015-06-26 19:37:20	nooryani84	Only RC7
2015-06-26 19:37:35	charlesay	nooryani84: are you on unstable track?

2015-06-26 19:38:00	nooryani84	I haven't changed anything, so no.
2015-06-26 19:38:29	nooryani84	I haven't used pacman in quite a while
2015-06-26 19:39:15	charlesay	manjaro has different update streams, default is stable which is a bit behind main arch
2015-06-26 19:39:32	nooryani84	i see
2015-06-26 19:39:45	nooryani84	Is it similar to stable/testing/sid?
2015-06-26 19:39:47	nooryani84	in debian
2015-06-26 19:39:55	Zenther	rc8 is in testing
2015-06-26 19:40:05	Zenther	final 4.1 is in unstable
2015-06-26 19:40:14	nooryani84	would you say testing is as stable as Debian testing?

2015-06-26 19:40:23	nooryani84	sorry for the stupid question

2015-06-26 19:41:23	+xstefen	closer in line to that at least, with the addition of manjaro changes
2015-06-26 19:41:28	nooryani84	So it should be good enough for most users?
2015-06-26 19:41:38	+xstefen	For the most part

2015-06-26 19:43:51	nooryani84	yea was looking there, think I'll try out testing to begin with.
2015-06-26 19:44:05	Zenther	testing only has rc8
2015-06-26 19:44:32	nooryani84	true, though there were very small changes between RC8 and final
2015-06-26 19:44:36	nooryani84	a few drivers etc
2015-06-26 19:44:43	Zenther	and that method is only temporarily changing branches
2015-06-26 19:45:08	nooryani84	You mean it doesn't remember?
2015-06-26 19:45:19	Zenther	change, install kernel... after reboot you are still on stable
2015-06-26 19:45:34	+xstefen	What?
2015-06-26 19:45:38	+xstefen	You can set it permanent
2015-06-26 19:45:51	Zenther	yes, IF you edit the .conf
2015-06-26 19:45:55	nooryani84	further down it says you can change it in /etc/pacman-mirrors.conf

2015-06-26 19:49:49	+xstefen	because you have onboard intel graphics, not disabled, so it silly-ly detects both

2015-06-26 20:41:50	nooryani84	i think win 10 will be a "rolling release" where they'll move more and more onto the "cloud"
2015-06-26 20:41:54	anoki	don't game that much... when I do it's on a console, occasional racing or fighting game. can't concentrate on explosions and FPS 
2015-06-26 20:42:18	anoki	I guess I emulate some old nintendo games and such which works on linux
2015-06-26 20:42:21	heartofalion_	When I run lsusb then it seems to list a number of devices, but not my printer
2015-06-26 20:42:21	heartofalion_	I'll check oput openprinting
2015-06-26 20:42:57	nooryani84	anoki, http://www.lakka.tv/ looks pretty nice
2015-06-26 20:43:23	nooryani84	heartofalion_, don't rule out the possibility that the hub could have a bad port.
2015-06-26 20:43:51	heartofalion_	Well, when I boot to windows it printing works with the hub, same port.
2015-06-26 20:43:51	CountryfiedLinux	I like the idea of cloud-based apps.
2015-06-26 20:44:03	CountryfiedLinux	Powered by someone else's servers, frees up my own hardware.
2015-06-26 20:44:18	nooryani84	It's not inherently bad

2015-06-26 20:45:00	anoki	nooryani84: I wonder if that would work on raspberri pi? I have been thinking of making an arch based insatall on one and only using it for emulating games
2015-06-26 20:45:02	CountryfiedLinux	Right now my main 2 are Wondershare Filmora and Kdenlive.
2015-06-26 20:45:17	nooryani84	I could say I use it for non-sensitive data, though the more and more people use it... the more widespread it becomes.
2015-06-26 20:45:38	anoki	just stick it to the back of a moniter and have a game controller or two
2015-06-26 20:45:45	nooryani84	anoki, raspberry pi already has a failry good solution for that.
2015-06-26 20:45:59	nooryani84	They both use the libretro project as a base.

2015-06-26 20:48:07	nooryani84	Try it out in Linux :)
2015-06-26 20:48:28	manjaro-kde5	nooryani84: thank you for your help 
2015-06-26 20:48:43	nooryani84	I've only used emulationstation with retroarch ( http://www.libretro.com/ ), which worked well for SNES and PSX games.
2015-06-26 20:48:57	nooryani84	manjaro-kde5: which solution did you end up using?
2015-06-26 20:49:51	anoki	nooryani84: thanks for those links, I made up my mind, I am making a retro gamning console now. badass, I can put it in my pocket and take it to one of my friends houses and only have to lug a few controllers around.

2015-06-26 20:57:26	anoki	no way that gamepad even looks like it's from the 90s haha, I expected the same button format but they got the whole round thick and flat as a board with the solid D-pad
2015-06-26 20:57:36	nooryani84	haha
2015-06-26 20:57:43	nooryani84	I'm telling you
2015-06-26 20:57:48	nooryani84	its very close to the real thing
2015-06-26 20:58:23	nooryani84	the d-pad is usually all wrong on the other copycats
2015-06-26 20:58:44	nooryani84	too stiff or not accurate

2015-06-26 20:59:48	nooryani84	the snes is pretty much the only console i always go back to

2015-06-26 20:59:55	nooryani84	oh yea
2015-06-26 21:00:05	linux_dream	for me nes or n64
2015-06-26 21:00:25	nooryani84	I can do n64 or nes for short stints, though i get bored of it pretty quickly
2015-06-26 21:00:34	anoki	I go to nes too for mario3 and some other fun games from the 80s/ early 90s
2015-06-26 21:00:43	nooryani84	SNES for some reason doesn't seem to become outdated imo
2015-06-26 21:00:46	linux_dream	zelda on n64.  or jet force gemini
2015-06-26 21:01:13	linux_dream	yah mario3 rocks on nes
2015-06-26 21:01:24	nooryani84	After playing zelda ooc on 3DS you will cringe at the N64 version
2015-06-26 21:01:40	nooryani84	though still a good game on N64
2015-06-26 21:01:41	linux_dream	yeah i've seen some videos on youtube about it
2015-06-26 21:01:47	linux_dream	and the mario 64 remake they made
2015-06-26 21:01:54	anoki	never tried to emulate n64 games, does it play as good as nes / snes?
2015-06-26 21:01:58	nooryani84	My favorite will always be Link to the past
2015-06-26 21:02:00	linux_dream	they've done majora's mask too
2015-06-26 21:02:15	linux_dream	yes anoki IMO
2015-06-26 21:02:18	linux_dream	very fluid
2015-06-26 21:02:23	linux_dream	even on old pc
2015-06-26 21:02:24	nooryani84	anoki, I have tried it a bit with an xbox one controller (natively supported in the linux kernel!)
2015-06-26 21:02:37	nooryani84	you can even clean up the picture quite a bit
2015-06-26 21:02:56	linux_dream	even a very old graphics card will emulate the n64 pretty well.  im talking about 2005 specs
2015-06-26 21:03:08	nooryani84	well
2015-06-26 21:03:15	linux_dream	now the gamecube is another story
2015-06-26 21:03:35	nooryani84	if you're running it on a raspberry pi, then you should have the newer version Raspberry pi 2
2015-06-26 21:04:10	nooryani84	which will run all of this very smoothly.
2015-06-26 21:04:10	anoki	well this partition has 8gigs of ram and 1TB storage.. so I don't think hardware will be the issue, I was just expecting frame glitches and tearing / freezing
2015-06-26 21:04:18	nooryani84	oh
2015-06-26 21:04:34	nooryani84	well I haven't really tried anything other than mario 64
2015-06-26 21:04:58	nooryani84	http://wiki.libretro.com/index.php?title=Nintendo_N64_Core_Compatibility
2015-06-26 21:06:04	anoki	I have so many windows open with your links, watching that video and buying Pi stuff / reading those articles
2015-06-26 21:06:12	nooryani84	That's for retroarch tho, which imo has a very good set of emulators
2015-06-26 21:06:20	nooryani84	ahh sorry :D
2015-06-26 21:06:37	anoki	its okay, no worries
2015-06-26 21:06:58	nooryani84	In general though, it seems like most games are well supported
2015-06-26 21:07:33	CountryfiedLinux	I don't think I've played any Zelda games.
2015-06-26 21:07:35	CountryfiedLinux	Not for me.
2015-06-26 21:07:43	nooryani84	Somehow i don't think you will be bothered that Pokemon Puzzle League doesn't work
2015-06-26 21:08:11	nooryani84	or Hey You, Pikachu!
2015-06-26 21:08:33	anoki	On a side note, I just re-installed to test plasma5. never was much of a kde user but this has brought me back. it's not visually distracting and overly busy and clunky like it used to be
2015-06-26 21:08:34	manjaro-kde5	i tried pcsxr and epsxe but they didn't work well and the emulation was slow  though they did when i use mint 
2015-06-26 21:09:26	nooryani84	anoki: i'm in exactly the same boat... i always wanted to like KDE though i always end up uninstalling it immediately.  They've taken a more minimalist approach this time, especially with the alternative launcher.

2015-06-26 21:11:04	manjaro-kde5	i didn't try retroarch before
2015-06-26 21:11:28	anoki	I think it was just the default layout of KDE, that icon set was horrid, and it seemed too much directed at new users.. now it is more flat and polished with a nice sleek menu and minimal yet elegant art
2015-06-26 21:12:03	nooryani84	You can use the Breeze theme if you have manjaro installed
2015-06-26 21:12:09	nooryani84	which is the vanilla KDE theme
2015-06-26 21:12:20	nooryani84	tho i like Manjaro's theme so far
2015-06-26 21:12:58	anoki	Yeah I was using breeze before re-install. I switched from KDE4 to plasma manually
2015-06-26 21:13:52	anoki	but I previously had GNOME on that install and deleting all the cross dependancies plus trying to get it set up like this release was a headache
2015-06-26 21:13:56	nooryani84	manjaro's Maia is quite nice
2015-06-26 21:14:22	nooryani84	Gnome is still a mess mimo
2015-06-26 21:14:24	nooryani84	imo*
2015-06-26 21:14:39	anoki	It's getting better but it's not there yet
2015-06-26 21:14:55	nooryani84	There are currently two DE's that are feature complete imo.  XFCE and Cinnamon

2015-06-26 21:15:36	nooryani84	KDE will hopefully be just about complete by Plasma 5.4 in august.  That's when they're supposed to get full wayland support as well.
2015-06-26 21:15:49	anoki	I think when everything doesn't have to be re-written after each update it will be okay, then the whole extention thing will work. I had it set up as a tiling WM and heavily modified it
2015-06-26 21:16:12	nooryani84	Yea.. I've read that gnome extensions break with every update
2015-06-26 21:16:23	nooryani84	Never had gnome installed long enough to experience that tho
2015-06-26 21:16:54	nooryani84	So many of these extensions should be part of default gnome settings tho
2015-06-26 21:17:08	manjaro-kde5	mate is cool too ,i t's lighter than cinnamon 
2015-06-26 21:17:11	anoki	mate is okay but it has reached a point where it will no longer evolve. cinnamon is beautiful but i find it boring... xfce is kind of frozen in time now...
2015-06-26 21:17:32	nooryani84	Mate are moving on to GTK3 i believe
2015-06-26 21:17:43	nooryani84	anoki, haha totally agree
2015-06-26 21:17:57	nooryani84	I think LXQT will replace XFCE when it matures
2015-06-26 21:18:19	nooryani84	IF it matures
2015-06-26 21:18:36	anoki	LXQT does look promising, I rather grew fond of razor-desktop despite how ugly it was
2015-06-26 21:18:46	manjaro-kde5	nooryani84: i am instaling retroarch from aur ,if psx runs slow i'll blame you for that :P
2015-06-26 21:19:29	anoki	I think QT is going to be the future of linux, gtk kind of dug its own hole and fell behind, I find qt just runs smoother in all aspects despite bloat
2015-06-26 21:19:33	nooryani84	There's just so many different opinions on where the desktop environment should go.   I don't think we need to change the desktop philosophy entirely, though it needs to evolve
2015-06-26 21:19:45	nooryani84	QT is the future of everything other than Windows imo
2015-06-26 21:20:12	anoki	thats why I came back to KDE tbh
2015-06-26 21:20:48	anoki	Might as well commit to it now before im forced to later, or I am stuck in limbo by refusing to convert
2015-06-26 21:20:57	nooryani84	manjaro-kde5, remember that the emulators are just cores, so unless they're packaged you will need to download them seperately.   I would recommend looking at Lakka which is the official project from the guys behind retroarch i believe.
2015-06-26 21:21:31	nooryani84	anoki: I just hope they settle on a design philosophy soon... will suck if it changes with every release.

2015-06-26 21:23:22	anoki	I think if everyond does "convert" to qt5 which would make things ALOT easier, it will be more of a global group effort, have one single software tree and polish polish polish the hell out of a platform. then from there they can slowly branch out to user's desired tweaks

2015-06-26 21:23:50	nooryani84	manjaro-kde5: nevermind - Lakka will appear inside RetroArch starting as of version 1.1. So far, users have been using a very low-fi menu called RGUI. It is perfectly scalable from low-resolution displays to high-definition TVs, but there’s no denying it looks very much like something you would expect from a DOS program.
2015-06-26 21:23:59	anoki	that way there wouldn't be as much breakage and it would unify almost all of the linux users into one giant project

2015-06-26 21:27:49	anoki	ubuntu and redhat mainly.. they have too much political influence on the opensource world
2015-06-26 21:28:22	nooryani84	It will be fine though, these kind of things were bound to happen sooner or later if Linux became more widely adopted
2015-06-26 21:28:31	anoki	Torvalds doesn't work alone he has a few people that could take over his role
2015-06-26 21:28:47	nooryani84	I suppose
2015-06-26 21:29:11	nooryani84	Don't know if they're quite as honest and direct as he is though

2015-06-26 21:31:34	anoki	he admits he isn't much of an end user and claims that most everyday users could bash a terminal better than he can, he just focuses on his work and isolates himself to that, he claims once he gets his desktop set to how he can visually stand it he will not touch anything at all besides his work
2015-06-26 21:32:39	nooryani84	haha
2015-06-26 21:32:51	nooryani84	Well i think i can understand where he's coming from
2015-06-26 21:33:19	anoki	it's funny because linux would not even exist if BSD had not ran intop legal trouble which caused him to write the first linux kernel
2015-06-26 21:33:36	nooryani84	I personally prefer to have something work out of the box even if I know how to get it up and running with a lot of manual work.
2015-06-26 21:34:05	nooryani84	i have gone the manual route too many times, it's not that fascinating after you've done it once.

2015-06-26 21:36:04	nooryani84	easier than prob 90% of linux distros just 3-4 years ago
2015-06-26 21:36:09	anoki	Lol back when I got into linux installed there was hardly anything that functioned through GUI, I sent my computer in for repair, and it came back with debian installed. The dude was supposed to explain to me how to work it but he got a job on the other side of the country and took a flight the following week

2015-06-26 21:37:01	anoki	I was thrown head first into linux and it was a frustrating long learning curve that I strangely enjoyed

2015-06-26 21:39:40	nooryani84	i think
2015-06-26 21:39:45	manjaro-kde5	nooryani84: how could you watch porn on dialup ?
2015-06-26 21:39:54	anoki	I don't think I could function without fiber optics, I can stream 5 movies withoput buffering, host a few servers, and torrent 20 song albums and still not lag

2015-06-26 21:56:52	anoki	I think that has to do with the way it searches for a signal, if you look at some of the newest wireless modems, they use lazer signals to single out a device and feed straight to it instead of through the whoile house

2015-06-26 23:11:27	heartofalion_	If you boot into an installed version of Manjaro, is it then possible to clone the partition on which it is installed and its GRUB boot partition via Clonezilla? The reason I'm asking is because the partition on which Manjaro is installed, doesn't show up in Clonezilla as an option to clone.

2015-06-26 23:59:30	pentastar	If you're using KDE, there might be a widget a the lower right side of your panel that's called Klipper. It saves things you copy to the clipboard.

2015-06-27 00:05:00	pentastar	Is it a lot of text?
2015-06-27 00:05:45	manjaro-kde5	pentastar: It's a list of ~1000+ addresses

2015-06-27 00:08:39	manjaro-kde5	I'm starting to think that's a kde 5 bug. This issue doesn't happen in XFCE at all.
2015-06-27 00:08:42	pentastar	manjaro-kde5: Have a look here: https://techtavern.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/fixing-copy-paste-issues-on-eclipse-and-kde/.
2015-06-27 00:09:48	pentastar	I'm too tired to read through it al, but there's an overview of how Klipper works, and some suggested workarounds/fixes. Hope it's of some kind of help to you.
2015-06-27 00:10:19	manjaro-kde5	And... pasting after pressing Ctrl-C twice crashes firefox
2015-06-27 00:12:24	pentastar	Might be worth running firefox from a terminal, to see what it says when you do that. The linked page suggests either removing Klipper from the taskbar, or unchecking "prevent empty clipboard" in it's settings.
2015-06-27 00:13:07	manjaro-kde5	If my suspicions with tests I did earlier are correct, firefox will segfault. Let's see.
2015-06-27 00:14:21	pentastar	Sounds like 5AM kind of fun to me! Finally got Plex working the way I want it at least. Now to fix my bricked phone.
2015-06-27 00:14:50	ubone	i use the middle mouse button to copy/paste
2015-06-27 00:15:11	manjaro-kde5	And, my suspicions are correct. It does cause firefox to segfault.

2015-06-27 00:17:37	manjaro-kde5	Well, apparently, you have to press Ctrl-C twice, then Ctrl-X, then it pastes correctly.
2015-06-27 00:18:33	manjaro-kde5	But, a thing to note is that, I had to do that using chromium, as pressing Ctrl-C twice makes firefox segfault
2015-06-27 00:20:17	pentastar	Good to see that it's (more or less) working!
2015-06-27 00:21:02	manjaro-kde5	Well, it's a bit of a workaround, but it does.
2015-06-27 00:21:31	manjaro-kde5	But, that seems to be a plasma 5/ kde 5 bug really. It shouldn't chug like that just because I'm copying too much text.
2015-06-27 00:23:50	pentastar	Maybe there's something about this problem in the arch wiki about Klipper

2015-06-27 00:32:00	pentastar	So far I've tried with Jodin3, but the phone disconnects and doesn't reconect after it Jodin3 tried to find the PIT.
2015-06-27 00:32:28	manjaro-kde5	Well, did you tried odin?
2015-06-27 00:32:55	pentastar	I was trying to flash stock firmware, and messed up somewhere. Was ages ago since I did it.
2015-06-27 00:33:14	manjaro-kde5	Does it enter odin mode?
2015-06-27 00:33:15	pentastar	Jodin3 and Odin should basicaly be the same.
2015-06-27 00:33:29	pentastar	I can enter download mode
2015-06-27 00:33:53	pentastar	Could get into TWRP before, but that doesn't work anymore either. Just download mode.

2015-06-27 01:12:44	ediT	all good 
2015-06-27 01:12:51	CountryfiedLinux	ringo32, Including Muon Discover on Manjaro would put it on par with Ubuntu in regards to user friendliness.
2015-06-27 01:13:08	CountryfiedLinux	For at least the KDE edition.
2015-06-27 01:13:22	ediT	-wtf-
2015-06-27 01:13:24	CountryfiedLinux	But then again it's not an official package.

2015-06-27 01:19:34	CountryfiedLinux	Manjaro is the most "complete" distro IMO.
2015-06-27 01:20:00	ediT	ooh...
2015-06-27 01:20:03	CountryfiedLinux	Power and flexibility meets user-friendliness and has a good and quickly responsive community.
2015-06-27 01:20:05	ediT	really 
2015-06-27 01:20:08	CountryfiedLinux	yes

2015-06-27 01:20:59	+ringo32	CountryfiedLinux,  personally we dont need to compete with ubuntu etc...
2015-06-27 01:21:01	ediT	you don't even fucking use the distro 
2015-06-27 01:21:20	CountryfiedLinux	It's flexible with dev branches that enable us to upgrade and downgrade at will, it's user friendly in that it's easy to learn how to use quickly, and the community has always been great.
2015-06-27 01:21:25	CountryfiedLinux	Yes I do ediT 
2015-06-27 01:21:37	CountryfiedLinux	I've been using Manjaro for the past 2 months.
2015-06-27 01:21:40	ediT	aren't you still on windows and candy ass linux mint 
2015-06-27 01:21:58	ediT	gee, shocker alert
2015-06-27 01:22:05	CountryfiedLinux	I'm primarily on kick ass Manjaro and sometimes Windows 10.
2015-06-27 01:22:12	grunhart	:S I predict a "sorry"?
2015-06-27 01:22:21	CountryfiedLinux	doubt it
2015-06-27 01:22:32	CountryfiedLinux	Assume and make an ass out of, well not me.
2015-06-27 01:22:41	CrimsonSunrise	The only way for you to compete with Ubuntu would be creating a council and being as shady as possible with trying to bend GPL to hold IP rights.
2015-06-27 01:23:00	CountryfiedLinux	competing isn't really necessary.

2015-06-27 23:07:16	linux_dream	Zenther-, do you call gentoo this way because updating the system implies long compiling time?

2015-06-27 23:07:26	manjaro-web|5273	I don't think so... I turned off touchpad while I type and it still happens. :(
2015-06-27 23:07:45	Zenther-	high maintenance with little rewards compared to arch I think
2015-06-27 23:08:07	Zenther-	arch is easier to maintain and more up to date
2015-06-27 23:08:10	linux_dream	im not getting the "high maintance"

2015-06-27 23:08:32	Zenther-	high maintenance == too much work involved
2015-06-27 23:08:37	linux_dream	yeaeh with arch you get what you seek almost instantly
2015-06-27 23:09:06	linux_dream	but once you've set your system and programs, gentoo seems easy to maintain
2015-06-27 23:09:22	linux_dream	much less to play with flags
2015-06-27 23:09:26	linux_dream	and stuff like that

2015-06-27 23:10:49	Zenther-	back to arch on the laptop
2015-06-27 23:11:00	manjaro-web|5273	anyway, I'm gonna mess around with some setttings on the keyboard.

2015-06-28 17:49:32	Nytram	Install Windows 8 and use Internet Explorer. It's much better than Manjaro for downloading porn
2015-06-28 17:49:42	phoidos	no native app?
2015-06-28 17:49:46	GNUaholic	:P or get a real partner and leave the hands alone

2015-06-29 11:31:43	tak3r07	Wifi does not work yet, hence i have downloaded broadcom-wl-dkms from aur, compiled it, copied pkg to usb and installed it on my xps. Afterwards i used "modprobe wl" for activating the module but it gave me "FATAL_ Module wl not found"
2015-06-29 11:32:27	+jonathon	why not just use the manjaro extramodules?

2015-06-29 20:19:22	tak3r07	Hey there, anyone out there for a little help :-)? I've just installed manjaro 0.8.13 cinnamon on my new Dell xps 13 laptop. The wifi was not working out of the box, so i did install linux318-broadcom-wl package from extra repo in manjaro (as i did with manjaro 0.8.13 kde a few hours ago where it has worked). I see the wifi network and can connect to them but i dont have a internet connection even tho i am connected
2015-06-29 20:19:32	tak3r07	Anyone has a clue about that?

2015-06-29 20:39:07	tak3r07	do i need dkms?
2015-06-29 20:40:06	tak3r07	since when i started figuring out the issue with kde, i had installed broadcom-wl-dkms and also dkms. But this didnt help so i removed broadcom-wl-dkms (but not dkms itself)
2015-06-29 20:40:06	+ringo32	mhwd -i pci network-broadcom-wl loads linux318-broadcom-wl, and make the blacklist automatically

2015-06-29 20:40:35	+ringo32	dkms is to process but the kernel i repo is alrready made
