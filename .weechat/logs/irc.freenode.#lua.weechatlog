2015-04-02 01:37:45	ttmrichter	aajjbb: One way to quickly get to speed in a language is to build a set of standard utilities that duplicate the functionality of tools like "ls" or "wc" or the like.  Pick a set of them and code away, comparing your output with the "official" version's output.
2015-04-02 01:38:06	ttmrichter	Make sure the utilities are simple, but not simplistic.

2015-04-02 21:03:12	cmtptr	if there's one thing arch got more right than anything else, it was pacman
2015-04-02 21:03:27	doub	except for the one letter options that don't make any sense

2015-04-02 21:04:57	darkstalker	arch sucks since they forced you to use systemd

2015-04-02 21:05:41	xyzzy_	if you had a choice between systemd being required for all distros, or resurrecting hitler, which would you choose
2015-04-02 21:05:44	haste	AUR on it's own is a mess
2015-04-02 21:05:49	cmtptr	exactly
2015-04-02 21:06:19	cmtptr	that's why it doesn't need to be automated by pacman
2015-04-02 21:06:25	darkstalker	hitler was a good artist
2015-04-02 21:06:32	haste	Exherbo does distributed package repositories like AUR should
2015-04-02 21:06:48	haste	and paludis supports it like pacman should have =/
2015-04-02 21:07:24	cmtptr	you can set up your own pacman repo to sync from

2015-04-04 15:10:08	furq	is that where you cover yourself in axe body spray and threaten to rape a girl because she tells you to fuck off
2015-04-04 15:10:19	furq	because i assumed that happened every night
2015-04-04 15:10:39	Neffi	that's not funny bro
2015-04-04 15:10:44	furq	yes it is
2015-04-04 15:10:46	Neffi	why'd you have to go there bro
2015-04-04 15:10:49	furq	it's quite funny
2015-04-04 15:10:54	Neffi	we were having a nice time like bros
2015-04-04 15:11:38	furq	i even said "axe" so you'd understand the reference
2015-04-04 15:11:42	furq	even though we all know it's called lynx

2015-04-04 15:13:02	klp_	I think I found a bug in lua 5.3
2015-04-04 15:13:03	Neffi	so it's just as shitty as all the others, is what you are saying, darkstalker? 
2015-04-04 15:13:05	Neffi	dmail: *
2015-04-04 15:13:10	darkstalker	sup
2015-04-04 15:13:14	Neffi	klp_: can you describe it? 
2015-04-04 15:13:18	klp_	if I do a.field = b
2015-04-04 15:13:23	klp_	and a has a metatable
2015-04-04 15:13:28	Neffi	sorry darkstalker I didn't mean to summon you. you may resume your slumber. 
2015-04-04 15:13:31	klp_	and b has a metatable
2015-04-04 15:13:41	klp_	then the setter of b's metatable will be called
2015-04-04 15:13:52	Neffi	can you show us in the form of code? 
2015-04-04 15:14:00	furq	"the setter"?
2015-04-04 15:14:26	klp_	both a and b are strings with metatables attached
2015-04-04 15:14:28	dmail	Neffi: what I mean is that your grandfather wears it thinking he is down with all the cool kids
2015-04-04 15:14:36	Neffi	oh ok
2015-04-04 15:14:51	klp_	__newindex
2015-04-04 15:14:56	Neffi	klp_: All strings share a metatable. That's how all types work except tables and full userdata. 
2015-04-04 15:14:58	klp_	handler not setter, if you like
2015-04-04 15:15:16	klp_	yeah
2015-04-04 15:15:19	klp_	but i set my own
2015-04-04 15:15:21	Neffi	so what's the problem? 
2015-04-04 15:15:33	Neffi	you tried to set a separate metatable on a and b? 
2015-04-04 15:15:41	klp_	well I want a's __newindex method to be called not b's
2015-04-04 15:15:52	furq	%5.3 af = function() print("a") end bf = function() print("b") end a = setmetatable({}, { __newindex = af }) b = setmetatable({}, { __newindex = bf }) a.foo = b
2015-04-04 15:15:53	yalb	furq: a
2015-04-04 15:15:58	furq	looks like it works to me
2015-04-04 15:16:31	Neffi	klp_: what do you mean by this? can you show us in the form of codE?
2015-04-04 15:17:02	klp_	it's difficult
2015-04-04 15:17:08	klp_	since I've used the C api
2015-04-04 15:17:11	Torhal	Neffi:  I'm not understanding your stylistic choices for typinG.
2015-04-04 15:17:28	furq	says the guy who doublespaces after a colon
2015-04-04 15:17:35	lu324	klp_, you can't set a different metatable for an individual string, it's shared by all strings
2015-04-04 15:17:41	furq	oh right
2015-04-04 15:17:42	furq	good catch lu324 
2015-04-04 15:17:47	lu324	doing setmetatable on a string changes it for all of them
2015-04-04 15:17:55	Torhal	Says the guy who doesn't bother with proper form whatsoever.
2015-04-04 15:17:58	 *	Neffi duct-tapes Torhal to the side of a Ferris wheel and turns it on
2015-04-04 15:18:01	klp_	aaaaaah
2015-04-04 15:18:07	klp_	so that's the reason
2015-04-04 15:18:16	Neffi	i just said this klp_
2015-04-04 15:18:19	klp_	a and b get the same metatable
2015-04-04 15:18:24	 *	Neffi facepalms
2015-04-04 15:18:29	 *	Torhal meltificates Neffi's collagen.
2015-04-04 15:18:53	klp_	so what should I do?
2015-04-04 15:18:55	 *	Neffi grinds up Torhal into a paste and sells it to vegans as super tofu. 
2015-04-04 15:19:06	Neffi	klp_: you should not depend on strings not sharing a metatable
2015-04-04 15:19:07	furq	klp_: that depends on what you're trying to achieve
2015-04-04 15:19:13	Torhal	Dayum, Neffi. That's some next-level shit, right there.
2015-04-04 15:19:17	Neffi	<_<
2015-04-04 15:19:29	furq	also i'm pretty sure Torhal contains animal products
2015-04-04 15:19:36	furq	at least if all the rumours i hear are true
2015-04-04 15:19:36	klp_	Neffi how come you know this?
2015-04-04 15:19:46	Neffi	what, Lua? 
2015-04-04 15:19:49	klp_	It would have taken me ages to debug lua's source
2015-04-04 15:19:53	Neffi	I've been using it for like 11 years now
2015-04-04 15:20:04	klp_	well that changing a string's metatable does this
2015-04-04 15:20:08	Torhal	Neffi was conceived by Lua.
2015-04-04 15:20:09	Neffi	"I've been using it for like 11 years now"
2015-04-04 15:20:21	Neffi	I kinda know a lot about Lua
2015-04-04 15:20:25	furq	klp_: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.4
2015-04-04 15:20:29	Neffi	It goes with the territory of not having much of a lifre
2015-04-04 15:20:33	furq	Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers, one for all strings, etc. 
2015-04-04 15:21:13	klp_	wow
2015-04-04 15:21:18	dmail	Neffi: has been using it for 11 years and he is still only 10. We have been trying to work him out :p
2015-04-04 15:21:19	Neffi	Torhal: Ah you think Lua is your ally? You merely adopted the Lua. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see other languages until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!
2015-04-04 15:21:20	Torhal	I was going to say, "Isn't that something you just kinda learn when you first start fucking with metatables?"
2015-04-04 15:21:25	klp_	so I basically was doing a forbidden thing
2015-04-04 15:21:29	Torhal	Yar.
2015-04-04 15:21:31	furq	it's not forbidden
2015-04-04 15:21:35	furq	it just doesn't work
2015-04-04 15:21:52	Torhal	No, furq - Neffi strictly forbids it.
2015-04-04 15:21:57	klp_	well I wrote this C++ wrapper for lua and am playing with it
2015-04-04 15:22:08	dmail	woot another one
2015-04-04 15:22:17	klp_	kinda wrote something similar to QML, only with lua
2015-04-04 15:22:18	furq	it's not against the law to write "ONE MILLION DOLLARS" on a piece of paper and try to buy a million twinkies at the gas station
2015-04-04 15:22:20	Neffi	how many is that now? 
2015-04-04 15:22:24	Neffi	has the counter on them overflowed yet? 
2015-04-04 15:22:25	 *	dmail chalks another mark to make it 2048
2015-04-04 15:22:31	furq	but as Neffi found out to his cost, it doesn't work
2015-04-04 15:22:51	Neffi	silly furq
2015-04-04 15:22:55	klp_	Neffi are there that many?
2015-04-04 15:23:03	Neffi	why would I try to buy a million twinkies at a gas station? 
2015-04-04 15:23:10	Neffi	gas stations don't even carry that kinda bulk supply 
2015-04-04 15:23:11	klp_	what's the best one of them wrappers btw?
2015-04-04 15:23:12	darkstalker	silly gringos
2015-04-04 15:23:17	furq	because you are fat and you love twinkies
2015-04-04 15:23:17	Neffi	you gotta do a deal with the factory, tard
2015-04-04 15:23:18	furq	whatever they are
2015-04-04 15:23:26	furq	and you also love the smell of gasoline
2015-04-04 15:23:28	furq	whatever that is
2015-04-04 15:23:32	Neffi	klp_: The best one is using the C API ;) 
2015-04-04 15:23:37	klp_	hahahahaha
2015-04-04 15:23:41	klp_	not it's not
2015-04-04 15:23:42	dmail	klp_: your one :)
2015-04-04 15:24:01	furq	i like "oolua" because it sounds like kenneth williams
2015-04-04 15:24:08	Neffi	klp_: I dunno. I'm biased. I think C++ is too obtuse many times over. 
2015-04-04 15:24:09	klp_	hohoho
2015-04-04 15:24:12	dmail	haha
2015-04-04 15:24:23	furq	also because dmail wrote it and i admire his face painting skills
2015-04-04 15:24:33	Neffi	dmail is a face painter? OOH DO ME
2015-04-04 15:24:44	dmail	Neffi: please rephrase
2015-04-04 15:24:54	furq	i think he said what he meant
2015-04-04 15:24:57	Torhal	dmail: Just pretend he's one of your French girls.
2015-04-04 15:24:59	Neffi	I meant what I said dmail

2015-04-05 22:19:47	MrSavage	why are there 2 colons?
2015-04-05 22:19:56	MrSavage	I thought you use colons for defining functions?
2015-04-05 22:20:22	darkstalker	also for calling functions on a oop style
2015-04-05 22:21:22	darkstalker	self:method() is equivalent to self.method(self)

2015-04-05 22:23:31	MrSavage	yes
2015-04-05 22:23:39	darkstalker	what one?
2015-04-05 22:23:42	MrSavage	c++
2015-04-05 22:23:46	MrSavage	java
2015-04-05 22:23:55	MrSavage	javascript, etc
2015-04-05 22:23:55	darkstalker	then the : is rougly method call
2015-04-05 22:24:05	darkstalker	just read it as .
2015-04-05 22:24:16	MrSavage	yeah
2015-04-05 22:24:21	MrSavage	 self:IsMultiplayer():is_client()
2015-04-05 22:24:22	MrSavage	but this
2015-04-05 22:24:27	darkstalker	but since lua has no builtin concept of objects, it uses : as a "method" operator
2015-04-05 22:24:36	hjpotter92	IsMultiplayer is not returning boolean
2015-04-05 22:24:38	MrSavage	it looks like IsMultiplayer is called then returns a value
2015-04-05 22:24:47	darkstalker	that's the same as C++
2015-04-05 22:24:54	darkstalker	you didn't know you can chain method calls?
2015-04-05 22:25:00	hjpotter92	or, if it is; then there's a metatable defined for the return value
2015-04-05 22:25:10	MrSavage	i don't see how it's not a boolean when it has the word "Is"
2015-04-05 22:25:18	MrSavage	"Is" functions are typically boolean
2015-04-05 22:25:26	darkstalker	probably it's not a boolean
2015-04-05 22:25:28	MrSavage	i know you can chain them
2015-04-05 22:25:31	xyzzy__	proabably just a dumb api
2015-04-05 22:25:32	darkstalker	it must return a callable
2015-04-05 22:25:34	MrSavage	but still it's very non-intuitive
2015-04-05 22:25:50	darkstalker	also mixed camelcase with snake case
2015-04-05 22:26:01	MrSavage	snake case?
2015-04-05 22:26:04	hjpotter92	MrSavage: source/library?

2015-04-05 22:28:36	MrSavage	+ i'm tired
2015-04-05 22:29:01	MrSavage	but yeah, one case it's boolean, one case it's not
2015-04-05 22:29:03	MrSavage	like wtf
2015-04-05 22:29:11	MrSavage	won't that break the execution?

2015-04-05 22:29:42	hjpotter92	MrSavage: yes
2015-04-05 22:29:43	MrSavage	i'm guessing the 2nd case is an object
2015-04-05 22:29:49	darkstalker	("{0}|{1}"):gsub("{0}", tostring(k)):gsub("{1}", tostring(v))
2015-04-05 22:29:50	MrSavage	don't you find this weird?
2015-04-05 22:29:52	darkstalker	u wot m8
2015-04-05 22:29:55	hjpotter92	but since there's a chain call
2015-04-05 22:30:03	hjpotter92	it'd fail with an error
2015-04-05 22:30:04	xyzzy__	i would call that something like "getMultiplayerSession' or something and make its return values nil/session instead
2015-04-05 22:30:25	xyzzy__	same deal for all those other ones
2015-04-05 22:30:35	MrSavage	also i noticed my file differes from the github one...

2015-04-08 00:17:01	cmtptr	the dell xps 13" with ubuntu released
2015-04-08 00:17:09	cmtptr	... and is $150 more than the windows versino
2015-04-08 00:17:10	cmtptr	thanks dell
2015-04-08 00:18:12	icelesstea	You are welcome.
2015-04-08 00:18:50	icelesstea	The price of the Shuttleworth license is $250.
2015-04-08 00:19:26	xyzzy__	gotta pay for that linux license
2015-04-08 00:19:40	xyzzy__	did you know? nearly 100% of linux users are using pirated linuz
2015-04-08 00:19:51	cmtptr	tbf I just said that for effect
2015-04-08 00:20:05	cmtptr	the reality is they just don't offer the lower-end model with ubuntu
2015-04-08 00:20:45	icelesstea	Aren't the ones that come with Ubuntu supposedly "developer" models or something?
2015-04-08 00:20:51	cmtptr	yeah
2015-04-08 00:21:03	cmtptr	apples-to-apples, it's actually $50 cheaper
2015-04-08 00:21:08	xyzzy__	2015 year of linux on the desktop
2015-04-08 00:21:19	icelesstea	2015 year of linux on the laptop

2015-04-08 00:21:31	LadyAlissa	until it comes to gaming
2015-04-08 00:21:37	xyzzy__	2015 year of javascript in the kernel
2015-04-08 00:21:40	cmtptr	"developer" model to me means thin client
2015-04-08 00:21:55	icelesstea	LadyAlissa: I game on Linux.
2015-04-08 00:22:09	cmtptr	I don't get why "developer model" seems to mean 512GB RAM and 60000TB SSD to marketting
2015-04-08 00:23:15	icelesstea	You'd think the ones that come under the heading of "developer" would have all the more room for further development.
2015-04-08 00:25:07	LadyAlissa	icelesstea: i'm not too successful in getting many games to run on Linux

2015-04-08 00:29:48	cmtptr	xyzzy__, why did you specify 5.2 for that
2015-04-08 00:30:00	xyzzy__	sorry should have used 5.3
2015-04-08 00:30:07	cmtptr	yeah
2015-04-08 00:30:26	cmtptr	should have used luajit

2015-04-08 00:36:24	BobbyJones	What do you use for GUIs?
2015-04-08 00:36:27	LadyAlissa	It was repeatedly stabbing myself in the stomach while crying my eyes out because I can't get GUIs working in Lua.
2015-04-08 00:36:32	LadyAlissa	my experience isn't too helpful c:
2015-04-08 00:36:37	BobbyJones	Lol

2015-04-09 00:26:09	JosephFerano	ok, let me try that, thanks

2015-04-09 00:26:37	bone	at least they shouldn't be, maybe they are on windows.  but you can account for that.
2015-04-09 00:26:48	Fr4n	you can still use real newlines
2015-04-09 00:27:37	JosephFerano	so that matches every character in the line
2015-04-09 00:28:03	Fr4n	use gmatch("[\r\n]+") instead
2015-04-09 00:28:08	JosephFerano	how would I know when there's a line break? Should I make an else and then a variable before the for loop that is the current line and then just appeand each time?

2015-04-11 17:28:16	icelesstea	I first read that "apt-get is bad practice?" and started to reply that no, using your distros package manager is a good thing.

2015-04-11 17:41:53	apt-get	Wait, That's a stupid question.
2015-04-11 17:41:53	CapsAdmin	i think it works everywhere in 5.3 
2015-04-11 17:41:53	CapsAdmin	but below 5.3 loops only
2015-04-11 17:41:53	CapsAdmin	% return VERSION
2015-04-11 17:41:59	furq	 it only works inside loops
2015-04-11 17:42:21	furq	%5.3 if true then break end
2015-04-11 17:42:25	furq	oh nvm yalb is dead
2015-04-11 17:42:35	CapsAdmin	o
2015-04-11 17:42:38	furq	you'll have to take my word for it
2015-04-11 17:42:42	apt-get	My engine uses 5.1
2015-04-11 17:42:49	darkstalker	break is for loops only
2015-04-11 17:43:03	furq	even if it did break out of if statements, it'd be useless because you can't put anything between break and end
2015-04-11 17:43:07	apt-get	Not "my" engine actually - the engine I use
2015-04-11 17:43:13	CapsAdmin	in your pastebin thing "while true do" is a loop
2015-04-11 17:43:16	CapsAdmin	yes you can break there if that's what you're asking

2015-04-11 17:45:47	apt-get	My answer is a very, depressing, yes.
2015-04-11 17:45:59	furq	well at least you're appropriately depressed by it
2015-04-11 17:49:34	apt-get	I'm trying to get used to love2d
2015-04-11 17:49:39	apt-get	I don't like roblox to be honest.
2015-04-11 17:49:39	CapsAdmin	what's wrong with roblox?
2015-04-11 17:49:39	CapsAdmin	i've never used it myself
2015-04-11 17:49:39	darkstalker	i need to make something 3D on love2d
2015-04-11 17:50:06	CapsAdmin	darkstalker, might be easier to use something that's meant for 3d instead
2015-04-11 17:50:07	apt-get	CapsAdmin: It's very, hmm. Limited, I guess I could say? You can't create a game from the absolute basics. Not only that, but you can't publish a game without the players having to sign up for an account at ROBLOX's website.
2015-04-11 17:50:24	apt-get	The players also have to download the ROBLOX engine.
2015-04-11 17:50:25	darkstalker	CapsAdmin: that's the point, doing it the hard way for fun
2015-04-11 17:50:38	apt-get	They also try to have a community in the game, which does not turn out well.
2015-04-11 17:50:55	apt-get	(in the game as in across the engine's website)
2015-04-11 17:51:16	CapsAdmin	it's too young?
2015-04-11 17:52:25	apt-get	CapsAdmin: That, and when the players are not young, they're immature. Only a portion of the developers make up the mature community that can hold a serious discussion, which are usually the developers that are cashing out hundreds of thousands of dollars from the game.
2015-04-11 17:52:25	CapsAdmin	i teach some children programming every now and then and atm we're looking at löve
2015-04-11 17:52:25	CapsAdmin	some of them wanted to learn roblox but i havent used it
2015-04-11 17:52:25	CapsAdmin	seems pretty straight forward though
2015-04-11 17:52:27	apt-get	CapsAdmin: Oh, I'm sure the kids would enjoy it.
2015-04-11 17:52:39	apt-get	ROBLOX has a great wiki and YouTube channel.
2015-04-11 17:53:06	xyzzy_	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2015-04-11 17:53:29	CapsAdmin	i "come from" garrysmod and i left for similar reasons
2015-04-11 17:53:58	LadyAlissa	I used ROBLOX for quite a while
2015-04-11 17:53:59	LadyAlissa	loved it
2015-04-11 17:53:59	CapsAdmin	i feel like i've done everything there is to do and the community (or at least the one I was in) never seemed to age
2015-04-11 17:54:51	LadyAlissa	but it added in so many things that makes other things easier
2015-04-11 17:54:58	CapsAdmin	which is fine in a way i think, i just feel it's time to move on

2015-04-11 17:55:01	LadyAlissa	so it wasn't enough of  a challenge.
2015-04-11 17:55:01	LadyAlissa	I'm actually one of those people who designed the first mouse-click tycoon games, instead of the ontouch() ones
2015-04-11 17:55:20	apt-get	LadyAlissa: There's DevEx now, in which if things are going easy for you, you can make real money from the game
2015-04-11 17:55:20	CapsAdmin	the gmod community was a bit more mature (16~ maybe if i had to guess) 
2015-04-11 17:55:25	apt-get	People are cashing out more than 100,000$.
2015-04-11 17:55:40	apt-get	It's pretty insane.
2015-04-11 17:55:50	LadyAlissa	Nahh.
2015-04-11 17:56:20	LadyAlissa	I'm out of the game design thing.
2015-04-11 17:56:29	CapsAdmin	there were people cashing in on stuff in gmod too but i was never really in those areas
2015-04-11 17:56:31	CapsAdmin	isn't it the same in minecraft?
2015-04-11 17:56:36	LadyAlissa	You can't make any money off of Minecraft mods or whatever.
2015-04-11 17:56:40	apt-get	CapsAdmin: Minecraft isn't really a game engine.
2015-04-11 17:56:50	furq	that's nothing
2015-04-11 17:56:51	apt-get	Also what LadyAlissa said
2015-04-11 17:56:53	apt-get	furq: For a 16 year old it is.
2015-04-11 17:56:53	furq	i heard about a guy who cashed out $100,000,000
2015-04-11 17:56:55	CapsAdmin	i remember seeing something about servers charging for in game items
2015-04-11 17:57:04	furq	and all he had to do was buy a winning lottery ticket
2015-04-11 17:57:08	apt-get	CapsAdmin: That's not allowed now.
2015-04-11 17:57:17	CapsAdmin	oh
2015-04-11 17:57:21	apt-get	CapsAdmin: you can get your server terminated for that with the new EULA
2015-04-11 17:57:26	CapsAdmin	garrysmod is kinda like source engine with lua
2015-04-11 17:57:42	CapsAdmin	roblox seems to try to be more of a game engine (i think?)
2015-04-11 17:57:48	LadyAlissa	apt-get: Well, there's a workaround
2015-04-11 17:58:18	LadyAlissa	I believe that's the case with both ROBLOX and Minecraft now.
2015-04-11 17:58:18	apt-get	CapsAdmin: It's a half-and-half of a game engine and a community.
2015-04-11 17:58:18	apt-get	LadyAlissa: What are you trying to say? It's impossible to have microtransactions in ROBLOX games.
2015-04-11 17:58:18	apt-get	Only with the virtual currency.
2015-04-11 17:58:30	CapsAdmin	anyway, i think these types of games are good
2015-04-11 17:58:37	LadyAlissa	apt-get: there was a way
2015-04-11 17:59:03	LadyAlissa	i forgot entirely how it worked but when I was about 12, I think, I found a way to download a list of users that were whitelisted, and I could then use that to determine who does what.
2015-04-11 17:59:08	CapsAdmin	maybe not in their current situation.. but playing gmod was how i got interested in programming
2015-04-11 17:59:19	LadyAlissa	Anyways, I desire a sammich.
2015-04-11 17:59:20	LadyAlissa	Later, noobs.
2015-04-11 18:00:06	apt-get	I started ROBLOX in '10 and that's what got me hooked into computers.
2015-04-11 18:00:41	apt-get	If it wasn't for that engine I probably wouldn't be in this IRC room right now.
2015-04-11 18:00:49	LadyAlissa	^
2015-04-11 18:00:57	LadyAlissa	same
2015-04-11 18:01:03	LadyAlissa	now, sammich D:<
2015-04-11 18:01:03	CapsAdmin	yeah same 
2015-04-11 18:01:03	apt-get	CapsAdmin: with gmod?
2015-04-11 18:01:03	CapsAdmin	yeah
2015-04-11 18:01:03	BobbyJones	love2d the best.
2015-04-11 18:01:03	CapsAdmin	i think i started around in 2010
2015-04-11 18:01:03	BobbyJones	Was there someone who said they didn't understand?
2015-04-11 18:01:03	CapsAdmin	so 5 ish years
2015-04-11 18:01:03	apt-get	I'm trying to work on a minigames game on roblox, but so far with my experience there's a lot of hacky things I had to do with the game.
2015-04-11 18:01:29	apt-get	I love the engine but I dislike it at the same time.
2015-04-11 18:01:29	CapsAdmin	lots of hacks in gmod too
2015-04-11 18:01:38	CapsAdmin	the grass always seems greener on the other side i guess lol
2015-04-11 18:01:49	CapsAdmin	i remember people coming from second life saying it had so many restrictions
2015-04-11 18:01:51	CapsAdmin	and roblox
2015-04-11 18:02:22	apt-get	roblox has less restrictions now than it ever has.
2015-04-11 18:02:22	CapsAdmin	but from my point of view roblox and se looks much more advanced than gmod
2015-04-11 18:02:22	apt-get	We're just waiting to be able to publish our games as native .exe files.
2015-04-11 18:03:13	CapsAdmin	or at least it did for a while
2015-04-11 18:03:17	apt-get	(Probably in the next few years we'll be able to do that? I hope to god that happens)
2015-04-11 18:03:41	CapsAdmin	ah
2015-04-11 18:03:41	apt-get	If that happens though, they'll have to allow us to do microtransactions with real currency. And that can get them into some legal issues I'm assuming.
2015-04-11 18:03:41	LadyAlissa	apt-get: if i could just remove half the BS libraries that I don't use
2015-04-11 18:03:41	LadyAlissa	then push as a .exe
2015-04-11 18:03:41	LadyAlissa	also
2015-04-11 18:03:47	CapsAdmin	i've coded my way out of gmod into my own "game engine" and just spend time on that :p
2015-04-11 18:03:56	CapsAdmin	like i did in gmod
2015-04-11 18:03:57	LadyAlissa	have they let users use non-roblox.com items yet?
2015-04-11 18:04:08	CapsAdmin	i've been spoiled with having the ability to fix and change code if something is wrong
2015-04-11 18:04:13	apt-get	LadyAlissa: Items as in assets?
2015-04-11 18:04:15	LadyAlissa	ye
2015-04-11 18:04:22	apt-get	Not yet. They have a family-friendly restriction for assets still.
2015-04-11 18:04:38	LadyAlissa	damn
2015-04-11 18:04:38	apt-get	It has to go through moderation. They allow you to upload custom sounds at least now though.
2015-04-11 18:05:31	LadyAlissa	Did I tell you I also made a custom data pack thing, also?
2015-04-11 18:05:34	LadyAlissa	you could install assets onto your computer
2015-04-11 18:05:41	LadyAlissa	then load them in the game
2015-04-11 18:05:48	apt-get	Yeah, but that's the issue.
2015-04-11 18:05:48	apt-get	<LadyAlissa> you could install assets onto your computer
2015-04-11 18:05:49	apt-get	You can't post a download link on your game page.
2015-04-11 18:05:49	LadyAlissa	Is there anything against sticking it in the game?
2015-04-11 18:05:54	apt-get	How would you get it in the game?
2015-04-11 18:06:08	LadyAlissa	Simple.
2015-04-11 18:07:09	CapsAdmin	anyway if you're wondering about love there's an offical (and active) #love channel on OFTC
2015-04-11 18:07:09	LadyAlissa	If an asset can't load, prompt with a GUI
2015-04-11 18:07:09	LadyAlissa	lol OFTC.
2015-04-11 18:07:09	apt-get	And then?
2015-04-11 18:07:09	LadyAlissa	debian uses OFTC but says it's their hostname >.>
2015-04-11 18:07:09	LadyAlissa	so the user can type a download link into their browser.
2015-04-11 18:07:09	apt-get	LadyAlissa: You can't use links in GUIs, your game would be taken down before you can blink.
2015-04-11 18:07:09	apt-get	You can post twitter links, though.
2015-04-11 18:07:09	apt-get	That's a workaround.
2015-04-11 18:07:37	LadyAlissa	text rendering via ingame meshes.
2015-04-11 18:07:54	LadyAlissa	i forgot how i did it
2015-04-11 18:08:10	apt-get	...That's interesting, but it's still breaking the rules hehe.

2015-04-13 02:03:35	furq	apparently this was released on vinyl, so maybe that explains it

2015-04-13 11:53:28	paul___	In SciLua ask for LUAJIT to have it install and I got stucked

2015-04-13 11:54:03	zash	just like lua
2015-04-13 11:54:08	stanreg	zash, in terms of performance/caching, is there a distinct difference between the approaches?

2015-04-13 12:06:37	TheCycoONE	so, I guess there's a difference between how the current directory part of the LUA_PATH is interpreted on Linux vs. Windows when running the lua interpreter.  We have foo.lua, with require('bar.lua'), and foo.lua and bar.lua are in the same directory.  Then from a 3rd directory we're calling lua foo.lua.  On linux it seems to evaluate fine, but on windows, foo.lua complains about not being able to find bar.lua.
2015-04-13 12:07:30	doub_	require usually expect modules names without file extension

2015-04-13 19:18:49	Satsuz	It's a piece of software that lets you connect to MUDs and MUSHes, text-based online games.
2015-04-13 19:18:51	cmtptr	if your problem is with the MUSHclient API (whatever that is), the there's a good chance nobody here will have ever even heard of it
2015-04-13 19:19:18	Satsuz	I don't -think- it's with the API, but then I'm so green I could be wrong.
2015-04-13 19:19:35	Satsuz	Certainly, I've been reading bits of Lua documentation to make what I've done so far.
2015-04-13 19:19:53	seeseemelk	whats the problem exactly?
2015-04-13 19:21:00	Satsuz	Well, the script is intended to take a string and cut out all of the commas.
2015-04-13 19:21:19	extor	What utility should I use if I want to edit a unix mbox style mailbox and strip away/replace certain text strings inside the body of various emails? Simple grep and sed won't cut it because all email bodies are randomly encoded in utf8, qp or base64. I've heard of grepmail and will check it out but any swiss army knife type of scripts already written in Lua?
2015-04-13 19:21:31	Satsuz	What keeps happening is that I get an error telling me I'm missing a comma somewhere, which clearly isn't the case.
2015-04-13 19:21:49	 *	extor is looking for the most efficient way to convert a unix mbox style mailbox file from a mixed 7bit,b64,qp,8bit encoded set of mails into a uniform mbox file where all the qp, base64 and 7bit encoded emails have been converted to utf8 for the purpose of running parsers on the emails

2015-04-13 19:26:40	cmtptr	also, I think you want inputstring:gsub(", ", " ")

2015-04-13 19:27:11	cmtptr	also, what is that %0?
2015-04-13 19:27:16	hjpotter92	it should ideally be inputstring:gsub (", ", " "):gsub('fasttravel','#')

2015-04-13 19:28:24	Satsuz	It's a regex thing. If I'm not mistaken, %0 means to take the entire pattern that it detects (separately from the scripting system).

2015-04-13 19:29:12	cmtptr	Satsuz, so you're saying the program loads your text, regsubs it, and then executes it?
2015-04-13 19:29:33	cmtptr	because that is sketchy as all getout
2015-04-13 19:29:46	cmtptr	I wonder if %0 is expanding to something with a syntax error in it
2015-04-13 19:30:03	Satsuz	I need to use a regex pattern because that's how it can tell one kind of command from another. Not everything that goes in the box is going to this script, just things that match my pattern.
2015-04-13 19:30:06	hjpotter92	I wonder is %0:gsub would work :P

2015-04-13 19:33:09	dmail	actually throw away values is one of the things that really annoys me with Python

2015-04-13 19:37:20	Satsuz	But yes, to answer your earlier question, %0 expands into whatever matched the regex pattern.
2015-04-13 19:37:58	Satsuz	For instance, if I typed "fasttravel e, e, e, ne" into the box, that would match the pattern and that is exactly what the script would see in place of %0.

2015-04-13 19:42:46	Satsuz	Yeah, I recognized rm -rf. I've seen it mentioned in other places at other times.
2015-04-13 19:42:50	furq	that's a good point actually, it's probably not escaping properly

2015-04-13 19:42:54	cmtptr	even that is unsafe though

2015-04-16 00:00:12	aajjbb	which os do you guys use ?
2015-04-16 00:00:30	Neffi	A library creates objects which have a method attached called :invoke() which invokes all callbacks attached using :hook(). When one or more of the callbacks errors, what should :invoke() do? Return an array of error messages from all the failed hooks? Or just return false indicating _something_ failed? Or? 
2015-04-16 00:01:05	Neffi	or should it take an error handler which is invoked upon each failure? 
2015-04-16 00:01:07	LadyAlissa	aajjbb: Ubuntu.
2015-04-16 00:01:50	LadyAlissa	If you were to call a :invoke(), what I would do is return a list of objects with a true/error value associated with them.

2015-04-16 00:02:35	LadyAlissa	I'd do something like { [

2015-04-16 00:03:40	Neffi	invoke will never raise an exception, but I think maybe it should indicate back to its caller that failure occured
2015-04-16 00:03:40	LadyAlissa	just write an error handler, then?

2015-04-16 00:16:26	Neffi	why the census? 
2015-04-16 00:16:46	LadyAlissa	Neffi: basically, it's a coroutine-based async library
2015-04-16 00:16:55	Neffi	yeah I got that part
2015-04-16 00:16:56	LadyAlissa	You yield by calling a cqueues function, and a value is returned back
2015-04-16 00:17:19	LadyAlissa	Yielding is done through receiving text from a socket, a signal, or some other pollable method.
2015-04-16 00:18:08	LadyAlissa	So, line = cqsock:read() -- yields, waits for FD to be polled, continues coroutine
2015-04-16 00:19:36	Neffi	:wraps() being called inside a wraped functions is confusing
2015-04-16 00:19:47	LadyAlissa	It basically adds in another object
2015-04-16 00:19:48	Neffi	but actually I get it makes sense
2015-04-16 00:20:04	Neffi	Does the event queue support multiple cqueue objects side by side? 
2015-04-16 00:20:10	Neffi	(not stacked) 
2015-04-16 00:20:13	LadyAlissa	Yeah
2015-04-16 00:20:20	LadyAlissa	It polls all of them
2015-04-16 00:20:23	Neffi	ok
2015-04-16 00:20:31	LadyAlissa	Resumes the coroutine that had a successful poll
2015-04-16 00:20:52	Neffi	what do you mean? 
2015-04-16 00:21:20	LadyAlissa	poll( fd1, fd2 ) -- where fd1 and fd2 are cqueues :wrap()ped objects
2015-04-16 00:21:25	LadyAlissa	or whatever the actual code is
2015-04-16 00:21:40	LadyAlissa	if fd1 has bytes ready for reading / has successfully polled, it returns.
2015-04-16 00:22:14	LadyAlissa	If fd2 has bytes ready / successfully polled, that resumes fd2's coroutine
2015-04-16 00:22:31	LadyAlissa	If neither have bytes ready / polled, it waits until either have them, up to a specified timeout
2015-04-16 00:22:34	Neffi	Hmm. It all makes sense but I'm at a loss trying to visualize a meaningful architecture using this. 
2015-04-16 00:22:48	LadyAlissa	HTTP server?
2015-04-16 00:22:51	Neffi	My goal is a modular IRC bot framework
2015-04-16 00:22:56	LadyAlissa	oh.
2015-04-16 00:22:58	LadyAlissa	hm..
2015-04-16 00:23:05	LadyAlissa	have you seen PotaDOSv5?
2015-04-16 00:23:06	Neffi	The core keeps a connection to the IRC server and modules plug into that with callbacks to provide functionality
2015-04-16 00:23:10	LadyAlissa	or is it v4..
2015-04-16 00:23:11	Neffi	No I have not
2015-04-16 00:23:26	LadyAlissa	Either way, my bot utilizes a way to have multiple cqueues socket connections open
2015-04-16 00:23:36	LadyAlissa	Uh, callbacks? eugh.
2015-04-16 00:23:39	LadyAlissa	coroutine.resume() dat shiz
2015-04-16 00:23:48	Neffi	Not totally decided upon callbacks, just the initial idea

2015-04-16 00:24:15	daurnimator	Neffi: I wrote a cqueues wrapper for irc engine
2015-04-16 00:24:21	Neffi	Connecting to multiple servers is not necessarily a must. I could always just run multiple instances of the bot for that. But if it's doable without complicating the architecture, it would be favorable. 
2015-04-16 00:24:22	LadyAlissa	while true do local line, server = coroutine.yield() if line:match( "^PING" ) then server:write( line:gsub( "I", "O", 1 ) ) end end
2015-04-16 00:24:36	LadyAlissa	oh, it's definitely easy
2015-04-16 00:24:45	Neffi	daurnimator: Oh that's right. I have the link to that saved, I think. 
2015-04-16 00:24:49	LadyAlissa	just cq:wrap() for each new instance of the connection.

2015-04-16 00:26:23	daurnimator	LadyAlissa / Neffi: a cqueues object encapsulates a coroutine scheduler. you can tell it to run a function as a new coroutine by calling cq:wrap(myfunc, args...)
2015-04-16 00:26:58	daurnimator	Neffi: when you're inside a cqueues managed coroutine, you can call cqueues.poll(ob) to yield until your object is 'ready'
2015-04-16 00:27:06	fxck	neffi
2015-04-16 00:27:11	fxck	do you have a repo for your irc bot
2015-04-16 00:27:17	daurnimator	so for a socket that might mean it has data waiting to be read
2015-04-16 00:27:55	daurnimator	cqueues then provides a socket library that uses this. so e.g. socket:read() internally polls until there's enough data.
2015-04-16 00:28:05	Neffi	fxck: No, it's not that far yet
2015-04-16 00:28:12	fxck	oh well keep me in the loop
2015-04-16 00:28:27	fxck	once there is a non shitty lua bot, i'm gonna be porting a shit ton of perl irssi scripts to lua
2015-04-16 00:28:29	daurnimator	(it also has a signal lib, threading lib, etc, which all use the underlying cqueues.poll(someob))
2015-04-16 00:28:32	LadyAlissa	fxck: wanna look at PotaDOS?
2015-04-16 00:28:51	daurnimator	fxck: it's pretty easy to do. check out my link above for wrapping irc-engine with cqueues.

2015-04-17 10:50:24	@rjek	So I would expect much slower than 3x
2015-04-17 10:50:32	@rjek	However, bubble vs quick
2015-04-17 10:50:49	@rjek	bubble with thrash the cache and GC, but the RAM will be ultrafast compared to the ARM's.

2015-04-17 10:58:40	ttmrichter	dmail: Yes, but you can still select a data set size before that class by running a few quick tests.
2015-04-17 10:59:21	ttmrichter	Just go up by multiples of 10 (or whatever) until you get a data set size that shows the surprising results.

2015-04-17 11:00:19	ttmrichter	I do remember my own wake-up call to algorithmic performance, though.  Where a bubble sort that wasn't finished after 24 hours was replaced by a merge sort that finished in seconds.  :)
2015-04-17 11:00:38	ttmrichter	(It was a pretty inefficient bubble sort, mind, without ANY of the usual optimizations.)

2015-04-22 11:11:46	Zupoman	impaktor: what do you mean „ugly” there? The fact that it does `f = function(x)`, not `function f(x)`, or the fact that it creates a local function and assigns it to a variable?
2015-04-22 11:12:05	furq	i presumed the fact that the inner function has the same argument name as the outer one
2015-04-22 11:14:20	impaktor	Zupoman: what furq said. 
2015-04-22 11:14:28	impaktor	That the x is overshadowed.

2015-04-22 23:34:55	paulk2	Tricycle, nothing should stop you from not using IDE functions in ZeroBrane; it's using Scintilla as ttmrichter noted, so it's the same engine underneath
2015-04-22 23:36:11	paulk2	ZBS has a lot of Np++ has and can be extended using Lua (you can do the same with Textadept); I think it comes down to the question of personal preference
2015-04-22 23:36:24	paulk2	come both and let us know. I can answer ZBS questions here or in #zerobrane

2015-04-23 00:20:29	ttmrichter	paulk2: Is there any support for eLua with ZBS?
2015-04-23 00:22:25	paulk2	ttmrichter, in what way? debugging?
2015-04-23 00:22:35	ttmrichter	Specifically that, yes.
2015-04-23 00:23:03	paulk2	if eLua can make a socket call (that mimics luasocket API) then you should be able to debug Lua scripts running there
2015-04-23 00:23:48	paulk2	ZBS supports remote debugging, so if you can run MobDebug, you should be able to do debugging (the only dependency is luasocket)
2015-04-23 00:24:15	paulk2	it's possible to mimic its API (i've done it for some systems that do socket calls, but don't support luasocket)
2015-04-23 00:24:38	ttmrichter	And luasocket has a metric ton of dependencies of its own.  Not really suitable for any but the most dubiously-named "embedded" systems out there...
2015-04-23 00:26:17	paulk2	as long as there is something to open socket and send/receive, it should be possible to wrap it into luasocket API
2015-04-23 00:26:23	paulk2	there are only few calls that are needed
2015-04-23 00:26:37	paulk2	here is one example: https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug/blob/master/misc/mosync.lua
2015-04-23 00:27:05	Neffi	ttmrichter: Downloaded Textadept Windows build, saw GTK, closed it ;) 
2015-04-23 00:27:16	Neffi	But looked through and was pleased to see it uses Lua extensively 
2015-04-23 00:27:46	paulk2	ttmrichter, the example only implements connect/send/receive/close (select is no longer needed)
2015-04-23 00:29:33	ttmrichter	paulk2: I'm confused by what "mosync" is here.  At the beginning you check if mosync exists and bail if it doesn't.  Then inside you call its facilities.
2015-04-23 00:30:12	furq	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmh_eAq9yp4
2015-04-23 00:30:15	furq	nice video ttmrichter 
2015-04-23 00:30:24	paulk2	ttmrichter, yes, it doesn't matter ;); it's just an example of an API that works with socket but doesn't support luasocket API, so I wrapped it to work with that
2015-04-23 00:30:39	paulk2	so the debugging can now work; mosync is a mobile toolkit
2015-04-23 00:30:43	furq	Démo du hack de célébration de but épique.
2015-04-23 00:30:47	furq	how is it even worse in french
2015-04-23 00:30:55	ttmrichter	OK, but ... I have no API that works with sockets.
2015-04-23 00:31:24	ttmrichter	Still looks like I'll be hand-rolling my own debugger.
2015-04-23 00:31:30	paulk2	there has to be a way to send data to do remote debugging ;)
2015-04-23 00:31:43	ttmrichter	Pretty much a raw serial stream.  No TCP stack.
2015-04-23 00:32:15	paulk2	you can still try to map it to send/receive calls
2015-04-23 00:32:22	ttmrichter	Building in a TCP stack would be pretty pricey in terms of memory real estate.
2015-04-23 00:32:38	paulk2	async aspects won't be working unless you can imitate that somehow
2015-04-23 00:32:48	paulk2	but the bulk of the debugger functionality should still work
2015-04-23 00:33:37	paulk2	it's not going to be easy, but should be doable
2015-04-23 00:34:32	ttmrichter	The idea here was to see if ZBS could be used to short-circuit a development effort.  It's looking like it's about the same amount of work as rolling my own in this case, so I'll be doing the latter.  ;)

2015-04-24 21:10:22	cmtptr	if it gets stolen you're boned
2015-04-24 21:10:59	q66	um it's common to use debit card to buy things in europe
2015-04-24 21:11:01	q66	everyone does it
2015-04-24 21:11:14	Alissa	o.o
2015-04-24 21:11:16	q66	if it gets stolen you tell your bank to lock it and issue a new one
2015-04-24 21:12:07	q66	+ you get your money back if they use some in the meantime
2015-04-24 21:12:36	q66	but yeah it's best if it does not get stolen
2015-04-24 21:13:13	Alissa	keep it attached to your body with a string and a staple in your leg.
2015-04-24 21:13:32	q66	or keep it in your wallet and don't lose your wallet
2015-04-24 21:14:00	Alissa	keep your wallet attached to your body...
2015-04-24 21:14:03	Alissa	:3
2015-04-24 21:14:12	q66	i keep it in my front pocket
2015-04-24 21:15:15	cmtptr	from what I hear, if it gets stolen here (by which I mean the number compromised, not physically stolen) and used, you're just shit out of luck
2015-04-24 21:15:34	q66	not here
2015-04-24 21:15:41	q66	as soon as you report it promptly, you get your money back
2015-04-24 21:15:55	cmtptr	how are you going to report it promptly if you don't know?
2015-04-24 21:16:01	q66	internet banking?
2015-04-24 21:16:09	cmtptr	what's an internet?
2015-04-24 21:16:30	q66	there is this web interface most banks have where you can check your transactions, make payments and stuff
2015-04-24 21:16:33	q66	ever heard of that shit?
2015-04-24 21:16:43	cmtptr	no I'm not very good at computers
2015-04-24 21:16:51	q66	ah ok
2015-04-24 21:17:00	q66	anyway, promptly == as soon as you find out it's missing
2015-04-24 21:17:09	q66	they will lock it immediately and thus make it useless
2015-04-24 21:17:47	q66	also, if they physically steal it and try to pay with it in store, they need pin
2015-04-24 21:18:14	q66	and if they try to pay with it on the internet, this "verified by visa" thingy requires you to enter another password you set from your internet banking before a payment can be made
2015-04-24 21:20:07	cmtptr	well, maybe it's the same here, I don't know
2015-04-24 21:20:20	cmtptr	I've never tried it just because I hear a lot of FUD surrounding it
2015-04-24 21:22:11	q66	the only reason to really use a credit card is to build credit history

2015-04-24 21:45:25	cmtptr	probably ls typo'd
2015-04-24 21:45:26	Alissa	Good 'nuff.
2015-04-24 21:45:39	cmtptr	so when you screw up an ls you see an animation instead
2015-04-24 21:45:40	Alissa	Actually it stands for "steam locomotive"

2015-04-24 23:26:44	BobbyJones	Um fairly good with it. but i use it in the context of game design but I'm good with lua just not with any of the packages in luarocks so i will have to learn how to use those.

2015-04-24 23:39:56	BobbyJones	Is Python more "marketable"?
2015-04-24 23:39:59	Alissa	Neffi: It was a joke.
2015-04-24 23:40:02	Neffi	yes, BobbyJones
2015-04-24 23:40:14	Neffi	Lots of people actually use Python for lots of stuff
2015-04-24 23:40:15	Alissa	BobbyJones: Python's more practical to use in software development.
2015-04-24 23:40:24	Alissa	Lua's good for scripting games and all but when it comes down to it, it 
2015-04-24 23:40:30	Alissa	isn't much of a money maker.

2015-04-24 23:41:36	BobbyJones	How about for a compiled language. What would be easier to transition to.
2015-04-24 23:41:42	BobbyJones	like c# or...
2015-04-24 23:41:58	BobbyJones	wait is python compiled?
2015-04-24 23:42:14	BobbyJones	or is python interpretted?
2015-04-24 23:42:23	Neffi	Python is interpreted. So is C#. 
2015-04-24 23:42:32	Alissa	Python and C# are both interpreted.
2015-04-24 23:42:35	Alissa	Both are also precompiled.
2015-04-24 23:42:46	BobbyJones	Oh.
2015-04-24 23:42:48	Neffi	Pretty much every interpreted language is precompiled now 
2015-04-24 23:42:51	Alissa	^
2015-04-24 23:42:54	BobbyJones	Oh
2015-04-24 23:42:56	Alissa	Precompiled and interpreted.
2015-04-24 23:43:15	Neffi	I think C# is JITed. Python probably has a JIT too. 
2015-04-24 23:43:22	Alissa	Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby (i think), Java, C#
2015-04-24 23:43:23	Neffi	Lua has a very good JIT

2015-04-24 23:43:51	Neffi	why do you want that? 
2015-04-24 23:44:02	BobbyJones	I really like lua
2015-04-24 23:44:06	Neffi	You can, but maybe you should consider just learning Python on its own 
2015-04-24 23:44:07	Alissa	Probably.
2015-04-24 23:44:14	Alissa	^^
2015-04-24 23:44:22	Alissa	Unless you want to legit use Lua in Python for something
2015-04-24 23:44:23	Neffi	If you want to make money as a programmer, you can't expect to stay attached to the one language you like 
2015-04-24 23:44:25	Alissa	which IMO is ridiculous.
2015-04-24 23:44:28	Alissa	^^

2015-04-25 16:31:43	Neffi	The only thing they seem to be missing is tha large FOSS community Github has
2015-04-25 16:32:09	Neffi	Well teams is an obvious feature 
2015-04-25 16:32:24	Neffi	But anyway so what? 
2015-04-25 16:32:44	Neffi	Nobody should have a monopoly on good ideas. Nobody benefits from that type of ideal except the assholes making the money. 
2015-04-25 16:33:35	Neffi	It would be very contrary to the spirit of the FOSS community to criticize a competing project for borrowing a good idea 
2015-04-25 16:33:38	Alissa	Keep a good service small or it'll turn into a bad one. It always happens.

2015-04-25 16:35:25	Neffi	Anyway, I'm really like bitbucket's UI. I think it's way better than Github's. Github's UI seems very brogrammer-ish. Bitbuckets UI is very organized, concise. I haven't once found myself asking where something is. Good use of space. No huge fonts or wise margins or other terrible hipster design cues. 
2015-04-25 16:37:12	Neffi	Plus free private repos is rather nice. And I can use Mecurial, which I'm reading up on for the first time, and it seems less arcane than git.

2015-04-25 18:59:23	roxlu	Alright .. testing some more things. I've got this code now: https://gist.github.com/roxlu/64c4e1f39badcb774ac3 
2015-04-25 19:00:30	roxlu	At line 12 I'm passing font into label:init(font). And I'm wondering how I can retrieve the user data from the font in C/C++ 
2015-04-25 19:01:15	darkstalker	the ; at the end is optional
2015-04-25 19:01:39	roxlu	I've update that paste with the Label and Font code 
2015-04-25 19:01:58	roxlu	darkstalker yeah .. that's years of coding c/c++ stuck in my fingers :) 
2015-04-25 19:02:22	darkstalker	what's that supposed to do? what's the problem?
2015-04-25 19:02:42	roxlu	darkstalker it's about this function: https://gist.github.com/roxlu/64c4e1f39badcb774ac3#file-lualabel-cpp-L44 
2015-04-25 19:03:18	roxlu	Basically my Label class wants a Font* to initialize it. e.g. label->init(font);

2015-04-25 19:04:47	roxlu	darkstalker you see what I mean? 
2015-04-25 19:05:18	darkstalker	looks like a C library implemenetation
2015-04-25 19:05:42	roxlu	yeah, though there some c++ objects
2015-04-25 19:05:47	darkstalker	the only wrong thing i see there
2015-04-25 19:06:08	darkstalker	the lua_register.. function is gonna get mangled by c++
2015-04-25 19:06:27	darkstalker	you have to "extern C" it
2015-04-25 19:06:30	darkstalker	because lua expect C api
2015-04-25 19:06:33	roxlu	yeah I'll do that, thanks
2015-04-25 19:07:11	roxlu	Do you know how I can get access to Font* in lua_label_init ?

2015-04-25 19:08:28	zash	deref a thing cast to a pointer to pointer to whatever?
2015-04-25 19:08:44	darkstalker	looks like something hacky
2015-04-25 19:08:55	darkstalker	you should convert that stuff to static_cast

2015-04-25 19:09:30	darkstalker	because it falls back to reinterpret_cast
2015-04-25 19:09:46	roxlu	darkstalker what's wrong with that? 
2015-04-25 19:10:01	darkstalker	it might be the wrong thing
2015-04-25 19:10:10	darkstalker	casts sometimes change the this pointer
2015-04-25 19:10:16	roxlu	ah ok
2015-04-25 19:10:54	darkstalker	also adds a bit more of compile-time checking safety

2015-04-25 19:13:12	roxlu	Someone advised me that solution earlier 
2015-04-25 19:13:41	darkstalker	weird
2015-04-25 19:13:55	darkstalker	you could allocate the memory with lua and use a in-place constructor

2015-04-25 19:13:59	darkstalker	or w/e was called

2015-04-26 16:09:17	furq	also they're 3d
2015-04-26 16:09:26	cmtptr	I only played the first metroid prime

2015-04-26 16:18:35	darkstalker	it's more efficient to just use mpeg videos

2015-04-26 16:24:23	Neffi	no I did not
2015-04-26 16:24:24	furq	also if 4chan is doing it then you should definitely not do it

2015-04-26 16:25:04	Neffi	what's wrong with depending on ffmpeg? 
2015-04-26 16:25:31	darkstalker	using big libraries makes your code smaller
2015-04-26 16:25:37	Neffi	you could always make it an optional dependency -- user installs it if they want advanced format support
2015-04-26 16:26:49	darkstalker	also most people will have ffmpeg/libavcoded installed by default
2015-04-26 16:27:05	darkstalker	lots of stuff pull it
2015-04-26 16:27:44	Neffi	If you have a desktop setup in any capacity, chances are you have it, yeah

2015-04-26 16:34:33	Neffi	which browser? 
2015-04-26 16:34:56	Neffi	chrom{e,ium}? knowing google, they probably rewrote all the codecs 
2015-04-26 16:35:03	bone	cmtptr is on windows though, right?
2015-04-26 16:35:12	Neffi	or rather, forked ffmpeg, changed it slightly, and imported it directly into the chromium sources

2015-04-26 16:55:05	Neffi	Of course not

2015-04-26 16:57:18	roxlu	yes
2015-04-26 16:57:23	furq	roxlu: if you're just loading the files and having them set globals then there is no simple way
2015-04-26 16:57:34	cmtptr	if it were me, I'd probably just close the lua state and make a new one
2015-04-26 16:57:46	furq	or rather there's no recommended way, you just need to save the initial state and revert to it, or spawn a new state
2015-04-26 16:57:53	roxlu	cmtptr furq , closing/reloadings seems to be a decent solution 
2015-04-26 16:58:32	furq	well i'd rather disallow setting globals in loaded scripts
2015-04-26 16:58:38	furq	or have them set globals in their own environments
2015-04-26 16:58:42	Neffi	furq: First sentence: emulator should not be in quotation marks, Lua should not be capitalized, Android should be capitalized. Second sentence: you should be "you have" or "you've". Third sentence: Lua should not be all caps, Android should be capitalized, easily is misspelled. Fourth sentence: Lua should not be all caps, bad syntax on "to 60%", no punctuation. 10 mistakes divided by 4 is a mean of 2.5 mistakes per sentence.

2015-04-26 17:00:54	furq	emulator should absolutely be in quote marks
2015-04-26 17:01:01	furq	because an interpreter isn't an emulator in any capacity
2015-04-26 17:01:06	furq	so the quote marks let you know that it's basically a lie

2015-04-26 17:01:53	Neffi	Anyway I really don't trust the app because the author called it "LUA" several times despite its logo making it obvious it's not an acronym -- also evidence they may not be entirely proficient in Lua. And the author is calling it an emulator which is dubious at best. An interpreter is not an emulator.

2015-04-26 17:04:04	furq	but it's trivial enough to build your own hot reload features
2015-04-26 17:04:06	Neffi	Also I don't know. The language doesn't actually support hot reload in any capacity. It's up to your code to be able to withstand being changed/replaced at runtime. 
2015-04-26 17:04:08	furq	and believe me, they will be hot
2015-04-26 17:04:09	_abc_	Well I refer to it as hot reload while it isn't that. Erlang was/is famous because of that feature.
2015-04-26 17:04:12	Neffi	which is not all that hard to do in Lua
2015-04-26 17:04:41	_abc_	I.e. reload scripts / libs etc. The state reload someone mentioned.

2015-04-26 18:31:56	Neffi	my local tests show mine is slower than falling back to the interpreter for unpack()
2015-04-26 18:32:09	lpghatguy	I'll show you my benchmarking code and you can rip it apart
2015-04-26 18:32:11	lpghatguy	maybe it's just wrong

2015-04-26 18:33:39	Neffi	really? 
2015-04-26 18:33:44	Neffi	my own tests show it's pretty slow
2015-04-26 18:33:52	lpghatguy	2.0.3 or 2.1?
2015-04-26 18:33:57	lpghatguy	I'm running the latest 2.1 alpha
2015-04-26 18:33:59	Neffi	2.0.3 I think
2015-04-26 18:34:06	Neffi	yeah I'm running stable
2015-04-26 18:34:18	lpghatguy	Neffi, here's my test code, could be brutally wrong: http://hastebin.com/fulebemeco.lua
2015-04-26 18:34:31	Neffi	mine might puke on very large tables because luajit's stack is not very big

2015-04-26 18:39:26	Neffi	isn't it like 2 gb on amd64?

2015-04-26 19:46:05	cmtptr	I mean, it was enjoyable
2015-04-26 19:46:22	cmtptr	it just feels very much on rails
2015-04-26 19:46:32	furq	i presume it's because it's a remake and so they have to use a smaller map
2015-04-26 19:46:48	cmtptr	it's
2015-04-26 19:46:53	cmtptr	really not that close of a remake
2015-04-26 19:47:03	cmtptr	how far are you?
2015-04-26 19:47:12	furq	well yeah but they presumably feel compelled to use a fairly small map

2015-04-26 19:48:34	cmtptr	like, I didn't play very far into the NES metroid
2015-04-26 19:49:02	cmtptr	but I'm pretty sure that basically once you get out of brinstar, zero mission completely diverges frmo the original
2015-04-26 19:49:14	furq	it's probably because i'm more familiar with castlevania but it seems like i've done a stupid amount of backtracking already
2015-04-26 19:49:29	furq	it probably doesn't help that i'm still not entirely sure what all the symbols mean
2015-04-26 19:49:32	cmtptr	and also later they start incorporating some areas from super metroid, which is pretty cool
2015-04-26 19:49:51	cmtptr	all of the metroid games have a lot of backtracking
2015-04-26 19:49:57	cmtptr	that part I kind of like tbh
2015-04-26 19:50:11	furq	castlevania does too but it paces it out a lot more
2015-04-26 19:50:21	cmtptr	you get to explore areas where you've already been in a new light
2015-04-26 19:50:24	cmtptr	oh, well yeah.
2015-04-26 19:50:46	cmtptr	that's just zero mission I think
2015-04-26 19:50:59	furq	yeah i played a few hours of super metroid and i don't remember it being this bad
2015-04-26 19:51:36	cmtptr	I think it's also probably because the original metroid had a lot of absurdly long repeating screens
2015-04-26 19:51:46	cmtptr	and so they condensed those for zero mission, making a much more cramped map
2015-04-26 19:51:57	cmtptr	cramped but way less annoying

2015-04-26 19:55:35	furq	that's the appropriately annoying way to say it
2015-04-26 19:55:46	furq	and i mean one of the various games' bonus character modes
2015-04-26 19:55:49	furq	sotn only has richter mode iirc
2015-04-26 19:56:02	furq	actually i think the saturn version has another bonus character

2015-04-26 19:59:19	BobbyJones	It seems like the main stream use is game scripting other than that it may be useless
2015-04-26 19:59:32	furq	also notice how the saturn can't do hardware transparency on sprites because it is an excellent console
2015-04-26 19:59:56	cmtptr	BobbyJones, why do you define usefulness based on who uses it?
2015-04-26 20:00:17	BobbyJones	not by who but where it can effectively be used
2015-04-26 20:00:29	BobbyJones	Which is shown by where it is used
2015-04-26 20:00:34	cmtptr	no
2015-04-26 20:00:48	furq	that shows where it has effectively been used
2015-04-26 20:00:52	furq	they are different things
2015-04-26 20:01:08	BobbyJones	I want to do more than just make games but everywhere else i turn i get stuck because proper groundwork has not been set up
2015-04-26 20:01:12	furq	also pls say "utility" not "usefulness" tia
2015-04-26 20:01:24	cmtptr	BobbyJones, lua is not a batteries included language
2015-04-26 20:01:33	cmtptr	python is that way --->
2015-04-26 20:01:35	BobbyJones	so for me i can't effectively use it in those situations.

2015-04-30 11:47:47	cmtptr	but there's a counter specifically for c functions
2015-04-30 11:47:54	TsT	I played to embedded all lua modules of a project in one lua file (it's big but usually it's working correctly)

2015-04-30 11:48:43	cmtptr	it just is, okay?
2015-04-30 11:48:58	TsT	pen is enlarged ?
2015-04-30 11:49:06	q66	pen is land
2015-04-30 11:49:22	TsT	and v1agr4 is comming...
2015-04-30 11:50:03	TsT	cmtptr a function x() end is a C function ?
2015-04-30 11:50:15	cmtptr	no, that's a lua function
2015-04-30 11:50:28	rjek	pen istone

2015-04-30 11:52:57	cmtptr	I haven't beaten the game yet, no
2015-04-30 11:53:04	cmtptr	whether I've passed you is hard to say
2015-04-30 11:53:25	furq	i'm up to the mantis looking boss who is fucking humping me and i don't know what to do
2015-04-30 11:53:26	TsT	ok my error is in fact a stupid bug of double open (do + function) but only one close (end)
2015-04-30 11:53:31	cmtptr	because apparently I forgot how to play the game without sequence breaking
2015-04-30 11:53:39	cmtptr	oh, so yeah you're still ahead
2015-04-30 11:54:00	furq	well i'm miles away from there now because i figured i might be missing something and went on a scavenger hunt
2015-04-30 11:54:01	cmtptr	I got to the grapple beam and was like "uuuhhh wait, aren't I supposed to have power bombs by now?"
2015-04-30 11:54:02	TsT	the lua interpretor should probably raise a error about syntax if it success to parse all the file...
2015-04-30 11:54:04	furq	so i'm in brinstar now
2015-04-30 11:54:06	furq	lol
2015-04-30 11:54:43	furq	also is it just me or is the grappling beam a terrible hateful thing
2015-04-30 11:55:26	cmtptr	no it's awesome

2015-04-30 12:21:59	aquanight	but why use goto when RAII can do it for you?
2015-04-30 12:22:11	aquanight	and you get exception guarantee against memory leaks
2015-04-30 12:22:43	aquanight	(using C++ exceptions while using a C library is, of course, bound to cause Extra Happy Fun Times, but that's a minor detail)
2015-04-30 12:23:32	q66	s/ while using a C library//
2015-04-30 12:24:32	aquanight	q66: exceptions, which are designed to make sure things are handled properly, are for some reason treated with all the hate goto usually gets. Why is that?
2015-04-30 12:24:56	q66	only C++ exceptions
2015-04-30 12:24:59	q66	and it has nothing to do with goto

2015-04-30 12:27:41	cmtptr	"The inability to gracefully handle errors in C++ constructors is one good reason to avoid constructors that do more than nothing, and use initialization functions instead."
2015-04-30 12:27:48	cmtptr	but initialization functions are also awful
2015-04-30 12:28:15	q66	i just use constructors and write code that never throws exceptions
2015-04-30 12:30:18	aquanight	I think a small part of it is probably because C++ decided exceptions would only be a runtime thing for the most part. The whole 'throw(whatever)' thing on the end of a function has pretty much little to no meaning to the compiler
2015-04-30 12:30:32	aquanight	they probably would have been better if they were more java-style exceptions, where it's compile-time checked
2015-04-30 12:30:45	q66	that said c++11 noexcept fixed some of the stuff
2015-04-30 12:31:03	aquanight	bonus points: you don't need terminate() because you can enforce things main or destructor must be throw() so they have to handle everything
2015-04-30 12:31:06	q66	particularly when it comes to knowing whether something will throw or not
2015-04-30 12:31:18	q66	throw() is deprecated
2015-04-30 12:31:26	aquanight	q66: does noexcept have compile-time weight? I've seen conflicting information
2015-04-30 12:31:31	q66	yes
2015-04-30 12:31:38	q66	especially on constructors
2015-04-30 12:31:51	q66	as there are type traits to check if something is nothrow constructible/copy constructible/move constructible/assignable/etc
2015-04-30 12:31:51	aquanight	q66: noexcept is solving the problem that throw(whatever) should have solved (and would have if it had compile-time weight)
2015-04-30 12:32:01	aquanight	if they had done throw(whatever) right, they wouldn't be needing noexcept now
2015-04-30 12:32:07	q66	yes
2015-04-30 12:32:11	q66	but throw() sucke
2015-04-30 12:32:12	q66	d
2015-04-30 12:32:14	q66	so noexcept sucks less
2015-04-30 12:32:29	q66	aquanight, you can also check if any arbitrary exception throws, at compile time
2015-04-30 12:32:42	aquanight	q66: yes I understand that. I'm saying if I had a time machine it would be great to back and thwap the committe upside the head and make them do throw(whatever) the right way
2015-04-30 12:32:43	q66	printf("this throws: %d\n", noexcept(someexpr));
2015-04-30 12:33:21	q66	this can be used to implement some of the type traits in combination with expression sfinae, but that is a bit of a magic :P

2015-04-30 12:34:45	q66	this also applies to nullptr
2015-04-30 12:35:13	cmtptr	speaking of nullptr, is (!x) still equivalent to (x == nullptr) ?
2015-04-30 12:35:27	q66	no
2015-04-30 12:35:38	q66	because x can be an object with overloaded !
2015-04-30 12:35:39	aquanight	"If your member object constructor throws an exception, and you want to catch it in your constructor, the normally ugly colon syntax gets much uglier." <- bonus points: even if you catch the exception in your constructor, you can't stop it from being rethrown except by throwing something else
2015-04-30 12:35:52	aquanight	seriously what the hell where the C++ people thinking
2015-04-30 12:35:56	q66	and x can also be a simple integer 0
2015-04-30 12:36:00	cmtptr	q66, assuming x is a pointer, of course
2015-04-30 12:36:07	cmtptr	give foo *x
2015-04-30 12:36:07	q66	if it's a pointer type, then yes
2015-04-30 12:36:10	cmtptr	given*
2015-04-30 12:36:12	cmtptr	ok
2015-04-30 12:36:58	aquanight	q66: wrt overloaded !, and by extension they can also overload operator == against nullptr_t
2015-04-30 12:37:09	q66	yes
2015-04-30 12:38:00	cmtptr	and I guess "static foo *x;" is now initialzied with nullptr, not 0, right?
2015-04-30 12:38:22	q66	it's the same thing
2015-04-30 12:38:32	q66	i mean, nullptr is not 0 but as a result it's the same
2015-04-30 12:38:47	cmtptr	then why am I ever writing it instead of 0?
2015-04-30 12:39:45	cmtptr	why ever write cmtptr when you could write my literal address?
2015-04-30 12:40:10	q66	cmtptr, the point of nullptr is not to fix initialization, it's to fix overloading resolution
2015-04-30 12:40:19	cmtptr	oh
2015-04-30 12:40:28	q66	when you have multiple overloaded functions or constructors, nullptr fixes the ambiguities
2015-04-30 12:40:38	cmtptr	right, that makes sense
2015-04-30 12:40:52	cmtptr	(I mean, there's still ambiguity)
2015-04-30 12:41:01	q66	there's not if you handle a nullptr case
2015-04-30 12:41:04	cmtptr	foo(bar *b) and foo(baz *b)
2015-04-30 12:41:09	cmtptr	oh
2015-04-30 12:41:11	q66	no, there's not
2015-04-30 12:41:17	xyzzy_	oh
2015-04-30 12:41:19	cmtptr	wait wait
2015-04-30 12:41:21	q66	because there is typedef decltype(nullptr) nullptr_t;
2015-04-30 12:41:23	q66	and then you define ctor
2015-04-30 12:41:27	q66	foo(nullptr_t) { ... }
2015-04-30 12:41:43	cmtptr	and it can tell at runtime whether to call that or one of the other ones?

2015-05-01 03:58:33	quaqster	well, when executing the program, it asks for some input. Size and Height
2015-05-01 03:59:02	ttmrichter	Right.  I got that far.
2015-05-01 03:59:15	quaqster	the script then runs till the buildFloor function, but when it comes to the buildWalls function, it gets stuck on line 74

2015-05-01 04:05:15	quaqster	ahhhhh, I see. I will remove that function, because I don't need it anyway :P
2015-05-01 04:05:44	quaqster	I will keep you updated ;)
2015-05-01 04:08:08	quaqster	that is awesome. That was the issue :S
2015-05-01 04:08:21	quaqster	well, thanks for anything ttmrichter ;)

2015-05-01 13:59:15	Neffi	Google turns up a single result with the keyboard <the module number> and "freebsd" and it's a mailing list entry of somebody asking how to get it to work with zero responded :( 
2015-05-01 13:59:37	Neffi	It's not a standard X-Fi. It uses a different chipset, it was not produced for very long, was not a standard offering
2015-05-01 14:00:04	Neffi	it's, uh.. "Creative Labs SB0950"
2015-05-01 14:00:30	Neffi	cmtptr: No, I'm good, thx
2015-05-01 14:00:33	Neffi	;)
2015-05-01 14:00:45	q66	Neffi, and it works on linux?
2015-05-01 14:00:53	Neffi	Haven't tested that, so not sure
2015-05-01 14:01:14	Neffi	also I can't seem to get my phone (MTP) to work. Installed mtpfs and fusefs and enabled both. 
2015-05-01 14:01:21	q66	apparently it does not
2015-05-01 14:01:27	Neffi	but I didnt bother looking into it
2015-05-01 14:01:37	q66	mtp definitely works, i use it
2015-05-01 14:01:44	q66	you just gotta configure devfs permissions
2015-05-01 14:01:53	Neffi	yeah, I just tried real quick, didn't work right away, rebooted, didn't work
2015-05-01 14:01:57	Neffi	Ah, maybe that's the reason
2015-05-01 14:02:06	Neffi	I had to change some perms for virtualbox's virtual devices to work too
2015-05-01 14:02:11	q66	as in, set the right perms for the user on the usb ports
2015-05-01 14:02:12	Neffi	I'll look at mtp's stuff
2015-05-01 14:02:21	Neffi	Wait -- I think I did that
2015-05-01 14:02:24	Neffi	I'll take another look today

2015-05-01 14:02:43	q66	you can try a quick chmod 777 on /dev/usb/* and /dev/ugen*
2015-05-01 14:03:06	Neffi	also I'm very disappointed that virtualbox's proprietary extensions dont seem to work on freebsd, and a cursory Google suggests that's just the case, but I might try to coerce that to work too
2015-05-01 14:03:15	q66	they won't work, yes
2015-05-01 14:03:19	q66	because they're binary only
2015-05-01 14:03:25	q66	and platform specific
2015-05-01 14:03:27	q66	blame oracle there
2015-05-01 14:03:31	Neffi	fucking orcale
2015-05-01 14:03:37	Neffi	maybe I can run Linux vbox
2015-05-01 14:03:43	q66	doubtful
2015-05-01 14:03:48	q66	it needs kernel modules
2015-05-01 14:04:07	q66	what kind of guest are you running in the vbox
2015-05-01 14:04:10	Neffi	I mean I don't really _need_ it. I just wanna have a Windows guest to be able to test stuff. And to run installers when an application works in Wine, but its installer does not
2015-05-01 14:04:26	Neffi	Windows 7 SP1 amd64 most likely 
2015-05-01 14:04:44	q66	hm
2015-05-01 14:04:54	Neffi	USB 2.0 support is not a dealbreaker
2015-05-01 14:04:58	q66	thought if you were running linux guest you could use bhyve
2015-05-01 14:05:05	q66	which would be way waster than vbox anyway
2015-05-01 14:05:12	q66	*faster
2015-05-01 14:05:18	Neffi	And I don't know if I need the extensions for shared folders, but who cares -- I can always bridge the network device and then transfer it over LAN
2015-05-01 14:05:26	Neffi	nah
2015-05-01 14:05:41	q66	don't think shared folders need the extensions

2015-05-01 14:06:01	Neffi	In fact I can't think of any reason why I would use USB devices in the guest
2015-05-01 14:06:02	q66	you need extensions for 1) usb 2.0 support with passthrough 2) seamless mode 3) dynamic resizing
2015-05-01 14:06:07	q66	4) integrated mouse
2015-05-01 14:06:12	Neffi	yeah I have no need for that stuff
2015-05-01 14:06:17	Neffi	wait what, integrated mouse? 
2015-05-01 14:06:27	q66	i mean, without the vbox window capturing it
2015-05-01 14:06:34	Neffi	oh, yeah, that's fine
2015-05-01 14:06:34	q66	though that might work without too
2015-05-01 14:06:35	q66	i dunno
2015-05-01 14:06:55	Neffi	well, if I can get MTP working, and my sound card isn't gonna work on Linux anyway, no reason to switch
2015-05-01 14:07:06	q66	mtp is easy to get working
2015-05-01 14:07:09	q66	i use it with my phone all the time
2015-05-01 14:07:17	Neffi	I'll just use my phone when I need to do Mumble/Skype 
2015-05-01 14:07:30	q66	why can't you use integrated sound card for that
2015-05-01 14:07:33	Neffi	hell, the Mumble client for the phone is better than the desktop client anyway
2015-05-01 14:07:44	Neffi	the integrated sound's mic/line in does not function
2015-05-01 14:07:54	q66	you can get that to work too most likely
2015-05-01 14:08:06	Neffi	that's the reason I bought the sound card. better analog out quality and proper line level was just gravy
2015-05-01 14:08:13	Neffi	No, it's broken hardware

2015-05-01 14:09:57	Neffi	alright. I might write a wrapper specifically for this -- run it from the port dir and it'll resolve dependencies, see if binaries are available, install them, and mark them as optional
2015-05-01 14:10:04	q66	make missing-packages will get you a list in format that pkg can handle

2015-05-01 15:05:36	q66	portmaster is useful if your entire system is installed from ports :P

2015-05-01 15:06:11	Neffi	Most packages seem to be _very_ conservatively built

2015-05-01 15:06:31	Neffi	pulseaudio? why? 
2015-05-01 15:06:42	furq	because q66 loves pulseaudio
2015-05-01 15:06:51	q66	firefox has no OSS backend, so it uses an alsa emulation lib, which sucks, because it won't detect my mic

2015-05-01 15:07:14	Neffi	I'm surprised Firefox doesn't have an OSS backend
2015-05-01 15:07:14	q66	and mumble's oss backend was rather odd last time i used it
2015-05-01 15:07:32	q66	only alsa and pulse

2015-05-01 15:08:44	q66	Neffi, pulse works rather well on freebsd when it comes to not conflicting with oss

2015-05-01 15:09:14	Neffi	I see

2015-05-01 15:09:18	Neffi	I've never actually use pulse
2015-05-01 15:09:22	q66	it takes 1 channel for rec and 1 for playback
2015-05-01 15:09:27	q66	acts as a regular application
2015-05-01 15:09:46	Neffi	Good to know it's not as horrific as people make it out to be, if I do end up installing it
2015-05-01 15:09:55	q66	it's more horrific on linux
2015-05-01 15:10:22	q66	because alsa sucks, and when used with pulse it will typically not do any sort of sw mixing, having pulse block everything :P
2015-05-01 15:10:40	q66	so alsa apps will use pulse's alsa emulation
2015-05-01 15:10:52	q66	so it will go alsa api -> pulse -> back to alsa, now low level stuff

2015-05-01 15:12:02	q66	version 5.0 is the one when it started being bearable
2015-05-01 15:12:04	q66	with much fewer issues
2015-05-01 15:12:43	q66	and on linux, pulse sitting on top of alsa is a much better and more reliable solution than alsa with its horrific dmix plugin that provides sw mixing
2015-05-01 15:14:45	q66	these days most people talk shit about pulse because of their past bad experiences
2015-05-01 15:15:45	furq	you mean like how people talk shit about systemd because of their past bad experiences with pulse
2015-05-01 15:16:00	q66	nah, systemd is genuinely shit
2015-05-01 15:16:16	q66	pulse used to be shit, but ever since poettering stopped contributing, it's been getting better
2015-05-01 15:16:59	q66	it's still a workaround to a lack of a decent system in alsa, but it works

2015-05-01 20:11:17	furq	then you need to stay on the leftmost block and super bomb
2015-05-01 20:11:25	furq	and you'll drop down but not hit the drop blocks
2015-05-01 20:13:14	furq	actually i just checked and that's wrong
2015-05-01 20:13:22	furq	you can super bomb the roof of the room on the right
2015-05-01 20:13:32	furq	and then there's a doorway leading left
2015-05-01 20:14:00	pez	hi. has lua an inbuild function like cycle in python?

2015-05-02 11:54:09	ttmrichter	Every sentence of the opening paragraph in the Wikipedia article is comedy gold.
2015-05-02 11:54:11	ttmrichter	Morris dance is a form of English folk dance usually accompanied by music. It is based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, usually wearing bell pads on their shins. Implements such as sticks, swords and handkerchiefs may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one or two people, steps are performed near and across a pair of clay tobacco pipes laid one across the other on the floor.
2015-05-02 11:54:24	ttmrichter	Usually accompanied by music.
2015-05-02 11:54:30	furq	that video explains everything you need to know

2015-05-02 14:47:13	furq	so you can go and select your save file and see "100%" on it and pull a smug face

2015-05-02 14:48:04	furq	yeah i figured it predates that sort of thing
2015-05-02 14:48:47	furq	i think sotn does it but probably mainly so it knows to unlock richter mode

2015-05-02 22:29:11	xxleite	cqueues uses libev, cool
2015-05-02 22:29:14	Alissa	It's solely based on file descriptors which makes everything pollable, which means the program uses up to nothing if you're just idling.

2015-05-02 22:31:34	xxleite	i mean, so simple that does need to compile
2015-05-02 22:31:42	furq	there's an important distinction between an event library and something which someone claims is an event library
2015-05-02 22:32:47	furq	xxleite: if you need this event library to work with sockets and whatnot, and you're not using luajit, it's going to have to be a C library

2015-05-02 22:34:11	Alissa	then rewrote like 4 in cqueues.
2015-05-02 22:34:21	xxleite	sorry for the mess ... i mean something like an pool of events, no need to be async

2015-05-02 22:57:38	furq	and it doubtless doesn't quite cover the situation you want to use it in
2015-05-02 22:58:11	furq	https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/105460?v=3&s=460
2015-05-02 22:58:14	furq	also it was written by this man
2015-05-02 22:58:36	xxleite	gonna do this my own, thanks furq, cmtptr

2015-05-02 23:00:43	furq	honestly i barely even understand what this library does
2015-05-02 23:00:58	furq	i mean i understand what it does, i just don't understand why it needs to exist at this level of abstraction
2015-05-02 23:01:27	xxleite	what is wrong with 100loc?
2015-05-02 23:01:39	furq	nothing
2015-05-02 23:01:50	xxleite	ok
2015-05-02 23:01:50	furq	but it means the problem is simple enough to write a solution for yourself
2015-05-02 23:02:01	xxleite	sure
2015-05-02 23:02:14	furq	and you might even learn something
2015-05-02 23:02:24	furq	like why you shouldn't pose for photos with a towel wrapped round your head
2015-05-02 23:02:46	xxleite	i need something like that, i'll use inheritance and some methods will override 
2015-05-02 23:02:59	furq	or why you shouldn't use second-person pronouns in documentation
2015-05-02 23:03:25	xxleite	good tips
2015-05-02 23:04:14	xxleite	... and for that i'll use events
2015-05-02 23:04:33	xxleite	wich will internally be called
2015-05-02 23:05:07	xxleite	like model:save() -> model.events:saving() -> model.events:saved()
2015-05-02 23:05:39	Rena	can __index be a table when creating a metatable for a userdata in C?
2015-05-02 23:05:47	cmtptr	sure
2015-05-02 23:05:57	Rena	k, thanks
2015-05-02 23:07:07	cmtptr	xxleite, just a suggestion, don't call that events
2015-05-02 23:07:13	cmtptr	those are callbacks
2015-05-02 23:07:19	cmtptr	or hooks
2015-05-02 23:07:21	cmtptr	or something
2015-05-02 23:07:29	xxleite	hooks is nice ...

2015-05-02 23:21:10	Alissa	oh.
2015-05-02 23:21:13	furq	\33 because i checked the source of something i wrote in C where \nn is octal
2015-05-02 23:21:23	Alissa	yeah i kinda figured after i pressed enter.
2015-05-02 23:21:36	furq	and i forgot it was octal
2015-05-02 23:21:45	furq	because i wrote this ages ago and then abandoned it when i realised it was useless
2015-05-02 23:21:56	furq	also this stream just broke and i blame you

2015-05-02 23:26:12	furq	well yeah
2015-05-02 23:26:18	furq	how am i going to tell if the stream is any good without watching it
2015-05-02 23:26:46	Alissa	i meant that as you're still watching it for free.
2015-05-02 23:27:01	furq	oh good jake gyllenhaal is here
2015-05-02 23:27:10	furq	and denzel washington

2015-05-02 23:30:12	furq	so it won't actually start for 90 minutes because they'll spend half an hour playing VT of floyd mayweather pulling a serious face at the camera while inspiring music is played and he says things about how much he loves boxing

2015-05-04 19:15:38	zash	rsc: You basically have an array there.
2015-05-04 19:16:13	rsc	zash: oh, sorry. I am not used to the Lua wording. But that explains why Google wasn't that helpful.

2015-05-04 19:16:49	hjpotter92	where t HAS to be indexed as contiguous array
2015-05-04 19:17:06	zash	hjpotter92: isn't that going to mess up next()?
2015-05-04 19:17:14	cmtptr	rsc, in lua they're called tables.  everything is a table.  but "array" or "list" or "sequence" is often used to refer to when you use a table the way you did there, where the indices are sequential integers starting at 1

2015-05-04 19:18:32	cmtptr	zash, you're allowed to nil things out during a next loop
2015-05-04 19:18:47	zash	cmtptr: but table.remove may shift things around, that makes it scary

2015-05-04 20:00:35	cmtptr	and you can shoot out the back wall to help them escape
2015-05-04 20:00:48	furq	is that how you unlock richter mode

2015-05-05 12:04:44	furq	iirc it's valid if it's a pointer
2015-05-05 12:05:06	cmtptr	I thought you still had to at least forward-declare it

2015-05-05 12:05:15	q66	err
2015-05-05 12:05:19	q66	should be an error in c++

2015-05-05 12:05:23	furq	it sho is
2015-05-05 12:06:08	q66	ah, the "struct" keyword makes it possible to use without forward decl
2015-05-05 12:06:20	cmtptr	in c++
2015-05-05 12:06:21	q66	i guess the struct could be an incomplete type (as you're using a pointer)
2015-05-05 12:06:27	q66	so it won't mind
2015-05-05 12:06:39	q66	because all you'd have to do is "struct add_impl;" otherwise

2015-05-05 12:09:57	cmtptr	does it?
2015-05-05 12:10:00	q66	though, imo every struct use should always be a typedef

2015-05-06 10:59:52	torpor1	ok i'll try that

2015-05-06 11:00:34	cmtptr	because if it's 8 bits, two's compliment, it should be -128 to 127
2015-05-06 11:00:38	lu324_	it should be -128, unless your system uses some unusual representation for negative numbers

2015-05-06 12:50:26	doub	you'd need to get the win32 handle of the stdin, and call SetConsoleMode to remove ENABLE_LINE_INPUT
2015-05-06 12:51:00	doub	this might actually work with io.read
2015-05-06 12:51:35	nforce100	ah thx1 i try :)
2015-05-06 12:54:34	nforce100	at computercraft they have os.pullEvent() for it

2015-05-07 00:30:24	furq	which is almost like american sports
2015-05-07 00:31:20	ttmrichter	Snooker is pool for people who like to think a bit.
2015-05-07 00:31:21	ttmrichter	Snooker is an opportunity to look at Wikipedia or Google or wherever it is young people go to pretend they know things these days.
2015-05-07 00:31:26	ttmrichter	I like watching snooker.
2015-05-07 00:31:30	ttmrichter	I suck at playing it (or any other cue sport, for that matter).
2015-05-07 00:31:43	furq	did you watch the world championship which was on for the last two weeks
2015-05-07 00:31:56	furq	did you hang up pictures of ding junhui on your wall

2015-05-07 00:33:20	Neffiphone	OK guys its gone on long enough. haha. you got me. you can stop.
2015-05-07 00:33:46	Neffiphone	I'm not stupid enough to think there's really a sport named snooker
2015-05-07 00:34:29	ttmrichter	furq: I don't follow it (or any sport) obsessively.  If it's on and it catches my eye I watch it.
2015-05-07 00:34:31	ttmrichter	But I'd watch snooker.  I'd change channels for 8-ball or 9-ball.
2015-05-07 00:34:49	furq	well yeah i don't care about snooker
2015-05-07 00:34:56	furq	but i usually watch the world championship

2015-05-07 00:35:28	furq	i would say it's easy for me to remember it's on because it's on BBC2
2015-05-07 00:35:36	furq	but you're in china where i'm told they take it pretty seriously
2015-05-07 00:35:53	furq	on account of that it's a sport they don't dominate yet
2015-05-07 00:36:00	ttmrichter	Yeah, snooker has become a pretty big thing.
2015-05-07 00:36:12	ttmrichter	They don't dominate ice hockey either.  Nor football.
2015-05-07 00:36:26	ttmrichter	Because both of those require teamwork and the Chinese absolutely fucking SUCK at teamwork.
2015-05-07 00:36:35	furq	i meant a singles sport
2015-05-07 00:37:01	furq	they have a tennis grand slam winner now, so it's time to move on to snooker
2015-05-07 00:37:18	ttmrichter	China's FIFA run last time was hilariously bad.
2015-05-07 00:37:21	ttmrichter	And the real tragedy was they had a GREAT defence.
2015-05-07 00:37:26	ttmrichter	But their offence was all a bunch of glory hounds who'd try stupid shots instead of passing the ball to someone better-placed.
2015-05-07 00:37:28	ttmrichter	So their run was an utter shambles.
2015-05-07 00:38:16	furq	do you remember when the DPRK qualified for the world cup
2015-05-07 00:38:18	furq	that was good times
2015-05-07 00:39:11	furq	they did unexpectedly well in only losing 2-1 to brazil, because brazil set up defensively because they had no fucking idea what the DPRK team was like
2015-05-07 00:39:24	furq	and then the state media announced they were going to broadcast the following game live
2015-05-07 00:39:28	furq	and they lost 7-1 against portugal
2015-05-07 00:39:34	Neffiphone	#lua: sports-ish
2015-05-07 00:39:47	ttmrichter	But it'll be interesting to see how the Chinese do with snooker.
2015-05-07 00:39:48	furq	except in pyongyang where they won 1-0
2015-05-07 00:39:55	ttmrichter	It's the kind of game they should excel at.
2015-05-07 00:39:57	ttmrichter	Solo sport.

2015-05-07 16:40:45	bone	however, typically userdata is used for this if you're going to be doing C-ish things behind the scenes.
2015-05-07 16:41:38	Alissa	So you'd make the userdata type, push that, then setmetatable with an index to the table with your functions
2015-05-07 16:42:55	jimmio	which would allow me to keep a pointer around for the C side?
2015-05-07 16:42:56	Alissa	Yeah.
2015-05-07 16:43:04	Alissa	Think so. :|
2015-05-07 16:43:19	bone	the userdata is a storage area allocated by lua, you can store whatever C things you want there.
2015-05-07 16:43:57	jimmio	without adding a weirdly named lightuserdata to a table... huh. Definitely going to give that a shot. Thanks, bone and Alissa.

2015-05-07 17:05:03	Neffiphone	sure jimmio
2015-05-07 17:05:13	bone	yeah, set all your functions into the table. set __index in that table to the table value, then assign the metatable to the userdata.

2015-05-07 17:05:50	cmtptr	but yeah, generally it is a good idea to set up the metatable before you setmetatable().  especially because some of the metamethods only work if they were there at the time of setmetatable
2015-05-07 17:06:00	cmtptr	or maybe it's just __gc, I don't remember

2015-05-07 17:18:25	jimmio	To set a table's __index to itself.. I need to copy the table? or maybe setfield isn't the correct function to use?

2015-05-07 17:19:50	furq	damnit bone
2015-05-07 17:20:16	bone	iirc, when you set a metatable, you need to have the metatable look things up some where, so if you're going to re-use that metatable with your functions, __index should refer to itself, no?
2015-05-07 17:20:38	cmtptr	do you even lua?
2015-05-07 17:20:45	bone	get over yourself.
2015-05-07 17:20:56	cmtptr	you don't /have/ to have an __index
2015-05-07 17:21:07	cmtptr	and in my opinion it's bad practice to set it to itself

2015-05-07 17:29:12	jimmio	It's the c function I pushed to the metatable.
2015-05-07 17:29:28	cmtptr	so
2015-05-07 17:29:47	cmtptr	this is why I don't like the idiom of assigning metatables' __index to itself
2015-05-07 17:29:54	cmtptr	it confuses the matter
2015-05-07 17:29:59	bone	it doesn't.
2015-05-07 17:30:29	jimmio	Well, it doesn't work, and I don't set __index to itself currently.
2015-05-07 17:30:36	jimmio	So, I'm going to try it xP
2015-05-07 17:30:48	cmtptr	you will need to set __index to something to get the obj:Method() behavior
2015-05-07 17:31:00	bone	like i said.
2015-05-07 17:31:02	jimmio	ah.. explains why it doesn't work.
2015-05-07 17:31:02	cmtptr	and that something should be the table that has the Method function
2015-05-07 17:31:12	jimmio	like bone said xP
2015-05-07 17:32:18	bone	it is easy to visualize if you view the metatable as the way for the vm to know where to find things, based on __index, __newindex, and things of that nature.  if you don't _need_ another table, it is fine to drop your methods inside of that table, so they are looked up there.

2015-05-07 21:48:07	Neffiphone	for a language that eschews redundancy and unnecessary features it's odd

2015-05-07 21:49:18	cmtptr	or with functions
2015-05-07 21:49:19	Neffiphone	yeah you have to repeat code sometimes but that doesn't seem like a motivating factor in the design of Lua
2015-05-07 21:49:25	xyzzy_	when we could use cheap iterators like python's range instead

2015-05-07 21:50:33	Neffiphone	it just seems strange that somebody who said break might be removed because goto can substitute it, left in multiple similar constructs elsewhere

2015-05-07 22:33:22	Willox	I've been hilariously tricked

2015-05-07 22:36:32	Alissa	So __tostring for the table /does things/?
2015-05-07 22:36:44	Neffiphone	what?
2015-05-07 22:37:07	Neffiphone	to string invokes __tostring  of present and uses its return value
2015-05-07 22:37:16	Neffiphone	fkin autocorrect
2015-05-07 22:38:08	zash	typing good Neffiphone 
2015-05-07 22:38:11	Willox	I could call tostring once and if the result isn't a string, call it again without allowing metamethods

2015-05-07 22:38:26	Willox	Does anybody know of a better solution?
2015-05-07 22:39:06	Willox	Actually, screw my users. I'll make it cause an error.
2015-05-07 22:39:11	Willox	they did this to me
2015-05-07 22:39:28	Neffiphone	don't do that
2015-05-07 22:39:37	Neffiphone	just to string the error object
2015-05-07 22:39:41	Willox	So I shouldn't emit an error when __tostring doesn't give a string?
2015-05-07 22:39:52	Willox	I think I should
2015-05-07 22:40:10	Neffiphone	umm. does tostring() coerce it?

2015-05-07 22:41:01	Neffiphone	that's terrible
2015-05-07 22:41:11	Neffiphone	to string should not emit a non-string

2015-05-07 22:44:14	Willox	__tostring can cause a stack overflow too which will not occur in my protected coroutine

2015-05-07 22:45:27	Willox	I'll just disable the __tostring metamethod

2015-05-07 23:37:08	furq	maybe you mean the bx100 or mx100
2015-05-07 23:37:16	furq	those are slightly cheaper
2015-05-07 23:37:32	Neffiphone	not the mx100
2015-05-07 23:37:38	Neffiphone	thatsbthe older one

2015-05-07 23:38:21	furq	yeah the mx200 is more expensive than the 850 evo on both sites i've checked
2015-05-07 23:38:27	Neffiphone	maybe k meant the bx100. crucial/micron released 2 models to succeed the mx100 -- one cheaper, without things like hardware encryotion , and one more expensive
2015-05-07 23:38:44	Neffiphone	which are the bx100 and mx200

2015-05-07 23:40:01	Neffiphone	sorry they were updates to the m600. and yes the bx100 is what I meant
2015-05-07 23:40:07	Neffiphone	furq I doubt it
2015-05-07 23:40:18	Neffiphone	avoid anything sandforce as a rule of thumb
2015-05-07 23:40:34	furq	the bx100 is barely any cheaper than the 850
2015-05-07 23:40:43	Neffiphone	lots of reported issues, poor real world performance
2015-05-07 23:40:52	Neffiphone	so get the 850
2015-05-07 23:41:19	furq	oh
2015-05-07 23:41:22	furq	ocz are owned by toshiba now
2015-05-07 23:41:40	Neffiphone	Samsung has been making incredibke drives. the issues with the 840 ego were a one off thing with the particular nand they used. the 850 won't have that issue
2015-05-07 23:42:07	furq	and it looks like it's using a toshiba controller
2015-05-07 23:42:17	Neffiphone	Samsung is integrated. they make everything. controller, nand, ram for the cache, etc.
2015-05-07 23:42:26	furq	well yeah so are toshiba
2015-05-07 23:42:32	Neffiphone	and they're among the best at all of them
2015-05-07 23:42:36	furq	and sandisk
2015-05-07 23:42:38	furq	and nobody else
2015-05-07 23:43:07	Neffiphone	crucial is micron owned. micron makes nand, but I think they use Marvell controllers
2015-05-07 23:43:41	Neffiphone	to be more specific crucial is Micron's consumer facing, not just a subsidiary
2015-05-07 23:43:50	furq	i only mention ocz because the arc is really cheap
2015-05-07 23:44:02	furq	i remember the vertex was utter shit and then they went bankrupt
2015-05-07 23:44:13	furq	but if toshiba own them now then i might have to look into it
2015-05-07 23:44:24	Neffiphone	meh. check others. Kingston, Gskill, Mushkin, Patriot
2015-05-07 23:44:39	Neffiphone	most of them are.probably rebrands of good drives
2015-05-07 23:44:54	Neffiphone	ocz has mostly always been shit
2015-05-07 23:45:27	Neffiphone	they started out appealing to the HURR GAMER crowd making passable products at best and went downhill from there
2015-05-07 23:46:23	Neffiphone	fool me once kinda thing. maybe they are passable now. maybe as rock is passable now too. I'm not likely to trust either one
2015-05-07 23:46:26	furq	well yeah but they've gone bankrupt since then
2015-05-07 23:46:32	furq	and been acquired by a real company
2015-05-07 23:46:36	Neffiphone	see previous comment
2015-05-07 23:46:56	furq	i'm not really sure why toshiba elected to keep the brand alive because i don't trust it either
2015-05-07 23:47:09	Neffiphone	I think peace of mind w.r.t. quality of the device storing my data is worth a couple extra dollars
2015-05-07 23:47:45	furq	well it's toshiba nand and a toshiba controller, and presumably toshiba cache too
2015-05-07 23:47:51	furq	so presumably it's just their budget ssd brand now
2015-05-07 23:47:53	Neffiphone	probably
2015-05-07 23:48:07	xyzzy_	maybe toshiba wants to use the ocz brand as a dumping ground for dodgy products since it has a reputation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-05-07 23:48:16	Neffiphone	up to you if you wanna be the testbed
2015-05-07 23:48:19	furq	shrug
2015-05-07 23:48:26	Neffiphone	exactly what xy said
2015-05-07 23:48:29	furq	the 240GB one is really cheap so i might consider it
2015-05-07 23:48:43	Neffiphone	you get what you pay for.
2015-05-07 23:49:05	Neffiphone	cheapen out on your case. cheapen out on your mousepad. don't cheapen out on core components
2015-05-07 23:49:58	Neffiphone	if anything read reviews first
2015-05-07 23:49:59	furq	i need a new mousemat :(
2015-05-07 23:50:10	furq	and yeah i am obviously going to obsessively read reviews and then not trust them
2015-05-07 23:50:18	furq	if i wasn't doing that i'd have bought an ssd six months ago
2015-05-07 23:50:22	Neffiphone	haha
2015-05-07 23:50:32	Neffiphone	there's 1 or 2 good review sites
2015-05-07 23:50:44	furq	well yeah but ssd reviews don't really cover whether it'll turn to dust in six months
2015-05-07 23:50:52	Neffiphone	I tend to check if anandtech did a review before anyone else
2015-05-07 23:51:03	Neffiphone	true-ish
2015-05-07 23:51:22	furq	i'm still kind of annoyed that i missed out on the GTX770 sales ;_;
2015-05-07 23:51:28	furq	could've picked one up for £160
2015-05-07 23:51:34	Neffiphone	and are technical but they don't do many reviews nowadays

2015-05-07 23:54:25	furq	by "any good" i mean good enough to make intel lower their prices a bit

2015-05-08 01:21:55	LadyAlissa	i'm not sure of an example but you can bug bone enough to give you a small one
2015-05-08 01:23:33	bone	why do you want to call a function and not have it be popped?
2015-05-08 01:26:01	vifino	Webserver using Lua for dynamic content. Mainly for speed.
2015-05-08 01:26:33	bone	so you're going to be calling it repeatedly?
2015-05-08 01:26:41	Neffiphone	why don't you want the function to b popped? are you immediately calling it again?
2015-05-08 01:26:59	vifino	Yes, bone.
2015-05-08 01:27:17	bone	i assume you're going to have different args each time though, so pulling this function from whereever you have it stored shouldn't be that costly.
2015-05-08 01:28:00	bone	but you can easily use lua_pushvalue to duplicate the value on the stack, and just leave it there.  then on re-calls just push args, and then push the function again.

2015-05-08 11:47:05	ThinThread	hm... im trying to build lua, but it seems it wants to build in local directory =(
2015-05-08 11:47:28	ThinThread	the proper way is to run configure make from a seperate binary directory, ie one for osx, one for android, one for iphone
2015-05-08 11:47:39	cmtptr	lua doesn't use autotools
2015-05-08 11:47:53	rjek	Because it wants to be portable.
2015-05-08 11:47:58	rjek	Ironically.
2015-05-08 11:48:18	ThinThread	oh actually maybe there is new lua with CMakeLists, nice
2015-05-08 11:48:28	rjek	But that's fine; a whole unpack of the Lua sources is probably smaller than the automake-generated Makefile
2015-05-08 11:49:58	cmtptr	lua doesn't distribute with a CMakeLists, either
2015-05-08 11:50:12	rjek	Because it wants to be portable.
2015-05-08 11:50:18	ThinThread	seems to be here https://github.com/LuaDist/lua
2015-05-08 11:50:26	rjek	LuaDist != Lua
2015-05-08 11:50:31	ThinThread	ahh
2015-05-08 11:50:35	cmtptr	http://www.lua.org/ftp/
2015-05-08 11:51:01	cmtptr	the "proper way" to build lua is to configure src/luaconf.h the way you want and type "make <plat>"
2015-05-08 11:51:48	ThinThread	that way doesnt play very nice with multiplatform build trees
2015-05-08 11:52:13	rjek	Sure it does.
2015-05-08 11:52:18	rjek	make, make install, make clean.
2015-05-08 11:52:28	rjek	Just set where you want the libraries being placed.
2015-05-08 11:52:30	ThinThread	that puts object files under the local dir
2015-05-08 11:52:45	q66	so integrate lua build into your project's build
2015-05-08 11:52:51	q66	it's as simple as it can get
2015-05-08 11:53:18	cmtptr	cp -rl src/lua $plat/lua; cd $plat/lua && make $plat
2015-05-08 11:53:19	rjek	rm luac.c lua.c; cc -shared -o liblua.so *.c
2015-05-08 11:53:32	cmtptr	works fine for me
2015-05-08 11:53:57	ThinThread	yeah i guess i can do the cp -r
2015-05-08 11:54:19	cmtptr	oh sorry actually I use cp -Trs build/$plat/lua src/lua
2015-05-08 11:54:46	cmtptr	so you can even put build on another filesystem
2015-05-08 11:55:22	cmtptr	cp -Trs src/lua build/$plat/lua
2015-05-08 11:55:26	cmtptr	I'll get it right eventually
2015-05-08 11:55:52	ThinThread	i think i mist just use this luadist, looks like nicely done repackage by people who know what theyre doing

2015-05-08 20:25:14	Neffiphone	I'd love a good WM that was Lua driven
2015-05-08 20:25:16	darkstalker	nice return format
2015-05-08 20:25:19	profan	it makes me wonder if people are scared away from lua by the non-idiomatic spaghetti out there
2015-05-08 20:25:36	Neffiphone	darkstalker that's not necessarily terrible
2015-05-08 20:25:42	profan	no that's pretty terrrible
2015-05-08 20:25:45	darkstalker	yea but i would've returned a table there
2015-05-08 20:25:48	Neffiphone	profan I suspectnmaybe
2015-05-08 20:26:09	darkstalker	also every line ending with ;
2015-05-08 20:26:09	profan	at least some people i know have only seen bad lua code, (like awesomewm) and didn't exactly hold the language in the highest regard until i beat them over the head
2015-05-08 20:26:13	xyzzy_	yeah if people get scared away we won't get ports of trendy libraries from other languages
2015-05-08 20:26:43	Neffiphone	sometimes when people hear I like Lua they laugh or snicker. most of them are getting their impression from roblox, minecraft and the like
2015-05-08 20:27:06	darkstalker	you can write shitty code in any language
2015-05-08 20:27:12	profan	forever in a niche
2015-05-08 20:27:31	Soni	it's funny how when it's not /me/ talking about the things I made, everyone talks about it

2015-05-08 20:28:34	Neffiphone	profan its fine. being niche keeps a lot of idiots away. if the cost is you have to reinvent the wheel a bunch, whatever
2015-05-08 20:29:04	profan	well, the cost is that i spend a lot of time writing stuff i feel is just sort of wasting time
2015-05-08 20:29:05	Soni	I wish Lua was GPLed tho so that my Forth VM would be the most awesome forth VM ever and nobody would be allowed to copy it and stuff
2015-05-08 20:29:53	darkstalker	someone write the killer web framework in lua
2015-05-08 20:29:56	Soni	(my Forth VM is essentially just Lua... except for the 20 lines of glue)
2015-05-08 20:30:05	profan	as a result, theres many things i dont want to use lua for, because other languages make it so much easier with the whole community around it making things
2015-05-08 20:30:48	xyzzy_	just make some killer web platform in lua and then we'll get all the hipsters
2015-05-08 20:30:57	xyzzy_	none of the others have really got taht magic touch apparently
2015-05-08 20:31:04	^v	Soni?
2015-05-08 20:31:06	profan	but i don't want to complain too much, lua is enjoyable to use still
2015-05-08 20:31:06	 *	^v runs
2015-05-08 20:31:26	darkstalker	but
2015-05-08 20:31:27	darkstalker	?
2015-05-08 20:31:29	Soni	Neffiphone, how about: windowManager.doStuff("function_name", "arg1", "arg2", ...)?
2015-05-08 20:31:47	darkstalker	i personally find lua one of the most enjoyable languages
2015-05-08 20:31:49	profan	that line could mean anything
2015-05-08 20:31:55	Soni	("KISS" extreme - single-method APIs)
2015-05-08 20:32:49	profan	and yeah, i've been working in python a bit recently and always find myself missing the semantics of working with tables vs python's dicts which easily comes into a spaghetti of ["keyhere"]["keythere"]
2015-05-08 20:32:49	xyzzy_	>doStuff isnt a method
2015-05-08 20:32:49	xyzzy_	what if i want multiple window managers each with one window
2015-05-08 20:33:06	Soni	(aka what you do in C to avoid too many functions)
2015-05-08 20:33:16	profan	what
2015-05-08 20:33:31	Soni	xyzzy_, each window manager would have its own Lua .-.

2015-05-08 20:33:59	Soni	profan, for example OpenGL
2015-05-08 20:34:00	xyzzy_	~fuck~ the topic. this is important
2015-05-08 20:34:07	Soni	single method to set ALL THE THINGS

2015-05-08 20:34:13	Neffiphone	topic
2015-05-08 20:34:37	profan	... OpenGL with it's thousands of functions?
2015-05-08 20:34:42	profan	I shall heed to the topic though
2015-05-08 20:34:44	Soni	profan, glEnable
2015-05-08 20:35:05	Soni	that's a single function that does about 1000 different things

2015-05-08 22:51:24	^v	so basically we needed to create a malloc implementation

2015-05-09 12:51:00	furq	ttmrichter: is it better than canadian football
2015-05-09 12:51:20	ttmrichter	Canadian football is American football with slightly more thought required.
2015-05-09 12:51:32	ttmrichter	(Field is a bit longer and you've got fewer tries before the ball goes to the other team.)
2015-05-09 12:51:36	ttmrichter	So it's still pretty dumb.
2015-05-09 12:51:57	furq	i know what the differences are because i saw that joke on 30 rock
2015-05-09 12:52:17	furq	prior to which i didn't know that you even had a separate league
2015-05-09 12:52:22	furq	i assumed you just sucked at it
2015-05-09 12:52:53	furq	or had opted out of it like a sensible country
2015-05-09 12:53:17	ttmrichter	No, sadly, we have the stupid game.
2015-05-09 12:53:33	ttmrichter	Indeed our league is basically the training league for the rich American teams.

2015-05-09 12:54:02	furq	well at least you have some good solid team logos
2015-05-09 12:54:23	furq	you need to do some work before you're up to KHL level though

2015-05-09 18:54:29	Lappy	well basically just trying to do a capture with a reddit url to get the subreddit and post id from it
2015-05-09 18:54:52	bone	Lappy: right, show an example of the URL.
2015-05-09 18:55:12	Lappy	https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/35elif/i_could_only_see_this_rainbow_with_my_polarized/

2015-05-09 18:55:32	Lappy	that's an example from the main page of reddit currently, so the parts needed would be "mildlyinteresting" and "35elif"
2015-05-09 18:56:01	LadyAlissa	"www%.reddit%.com/r/(.-)/comments/(.-)/"
2015-05-09 18:56:02	bone	is it something/comments/somethingelse?
2015-05-09 18:56:11	bone	er always something/comments/somethingelse?
2015-05-09 18:56:30	Lappy	(.-) captures everything there?
2015-05-09 18:56:37	bone	.- is lazy capture.
2015-05-09 18:56:48	bone	i would do ([^/]+)
2015-05-09 18:56:54	bone	to capture all characaters up to the next /
2015-05-09 18:57:13	bone	but both would work.
2015-05-09 18:57:39	LadyAlissa	What .- does, it captures up as little as possible. In my case, as little as possible until a /
2015-05-09 18:57:56	bone	yeah, basically it captures the character, then looks to see if the next character is /, if it is, then it is done.

2015-05-09 19:00:24	bone	are you always interested in /r/name/comments/id?
2015-05-09 19:00:34	darkstalker	you should try undertanding what happens there
2015-05-09 19:00:34	bone	or can comments be something else that you're interested in?
2015-05-09 19:00:37	Lappy	from what I can tell it always matches that setup yea
2015-05-09 19:00:38	darkstalker	don't just copy paste it
2015-05-09 19:01:07	Lappy	yea I'm understanding it, just from reading the patterns example online I couldn't really figure it out
2015-05-09 19:01:21	bone	mine is also a valid regex. ;)
2015-05-09 19:01:49	darkstalker	(.-) is tricky to get right, often its sattisfied with the empty string

2015-05-09 19:04:26	LadyAlissa	It's nice and simple.
2015-05-09 19:04:36	LadyAlissa	At least, until you find the hidden frontier pattern :)

2015-05-09 19:05:07	LadyAlissa	Also, Lua should be able to be run in ANSI C, which means that it shouldn't require any external code as darkstalker said.
2015-05-09 19:05:22	Lappy	ah true
2015-05-09 19:05:36	bone	Lappy: the lua binary when compiled is around ~150 to 200kb.
2015-05-09 19:05:43	bone	libpcre when compiled is > 200kb
2015-05-09 19:05:57	bone	(liblua that is...)
2015-05-09 19:06:16	Lappy	gotta love lua for being so small, great for embedded usages
2015-05-09 19:06:29	LadyAlissa	liblua is what contains all the functions, so the entire Lua function group is smaller than just PCRE

2015-05-09 19:13:50	lenny	Why do I have to run this function in order to not get the same exact math.random patterns? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/h4oyTRP7/randomness.lua
2015-05-09 19:14:19	Lappy	math.randomseed()
2015-05-09 19:14:43	lenny	Lappy: What about it, math.random is broken without it?
2015-05-09 19:14:51	LadyAlissa	lenny: math.random isn't a true RNG - the numbers aren't always random. Using a seed of os.time() gives a more random number.
2015-05-09 19:14:59	Lappy	you have to seed the randomness otherwise it doesn't have any unique starting point
2015-05-09 19:15:08	lenny	Thanks, LadyAlissa and Lappy 
2015-05-09 19:15:09	Lappy	I recommend seeding it with the system time or something along those lines
2015-05-09 19:15:30	lenny	A StackExchange user also recommended running math.random a few times right after doing randomseed, too.
2015-05-09 19:15:40	lenny	Which is what I did in that function. Is it necessary?

2015-05-09 19:19:37	bone	what are you using the random number with?
2015-05-09 19:20:12	darkstalker	random number generators are just very large sequences
2015-05-09 19:20:24	darkstalker	that sequence needs a starting points, that's the seed
2015-05-09 19:20:43	-->	Bantalon (~Bantalon@c83-251-38-104.bredband.comhem.se) has joined #lua
2015-05-09 19:20:47	darkstalker	since you're sampling only a small portion of that sequence, it looks random for practical purposes
2015-05-09 19:21:11	darkstalker	if you need true randomness, it needs some kind of external noise
2015-05-09 19:21:38	lenny	So if I were to do: "for i = 1, 2 do math.randomseed(1) for i = 1, 5 do print(math.random()) end end" It would print the same numbers 2 times?
2015-05-09 19:22:06	darkstalker	yes, every seed produces its own sequence
2015-05-09 19:22:22	lenny	Oh, that's interesting to know. Well, thanks for the help.
2015-05-09 19:22:30	lenny	I really appreciate it.
2015-05-09 19:22:37	darkstalker	so if you want good randomness, get a different seed every time

2015-05-09 19:22:47	darkstalker	os.time() is a popular choice for that

2015-05-09 19:23:08	darkstalker	assuming you won't call the program more than once each second
2015-05-09 19:23:26	darkstalker	but don't think it as a "safe random"
2015-05-09 19:23:40	LadyAlissa	The safest random is reading from a quantum bit.
2015-05-09 19:23:44	bone	he's yet to explain what this random number is for.
2015-05-09 19:23:50	darkstalker	if you know the program startup time and the random algorith, you know the entire sequence
2015-05-09 19:24:04	bone	so rather that prematurely explaining the consequences of the security aspect, let's find out what his intentions might be.
2015-05-09 19:24:07	darkstalker	secure random usually uses hardware noise
2015-05-09 19:24:31	Lappy	a lot of crypto implementations read from /dev/urandom, that's filled with noise from system hardware

2015-05-09 21:10:04	furq	oh
2015-05-09 21:10:10	furq	does it involve snake punching
2015-05-09 21:10:18	cmtptr	from what I've seen, yes
2015-05-09 21:10:21	furq	yesss
2015-05-09 21:10:27	furq	you won't be disappointed

2015-05-09 21:12:15	bobryan	I'm having trouble with this code: http://pastebin.com/ihXhktSF the error is: PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (user.lua:6: attempt to index global 'dht22' (a nil value))
2015-05-09 21:12:16	cmtptr	also what the eff man http://randomaniac.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hard_target20.png
2015-05-09 21:12:57	cmtptr	because you set it to nil on line 49
2015-05-09 21:13:03	LadyAlissa	bobryan: What does the 'dht22' module return?
2015-05-09 21:13:08	cmtptr	why did you do that?
2015-05-09 21:13:27	cmtptr	why is everything in lines 49-50 happening
2015-05-09 21:13:28	LadyAlissa	Also, totally didn't scroll to the bottom first.
2015-05-09 21:13:37	furq	i'm sure i mentioned that gun
2015-05-09 21:13:43	furq	it's one of the more ridiculous things in the movie
2015-05-09 21:13:59	cmtptr	furq, does it only fire if you contort yourself like that?
2015-05-09 21:14:06	LadyAlissa	cmtptr: I believe it's an attempt at getting it garbage collected or whatever because the user probably doesn't know how to use locals.
2015-05-09 21:14:21	bobryan	cmtptr, initially I was going to loop it from init.lua but I think it's better to do it here so yes, I need to remove those. Does the code actually get there before processing the tmr.alarm() though?
2015-05-09 21:14:28	furq	bobryan: yes
2015-05-09 21:14:43	furq	well
2015-05-09 21:14:52	furq	apparently it gets there before sendData is called
2015-05-09 21:14:56	cmtptr	whatever it is you're trying to do, this is not the way to do it
2015-05-09 21:14:59	furq	s/apparently//
2015-05-09 21:15:26	furq	on a side note you don't need to wrap sendData() in a closure on line 46
2015-05-09 21:16:13	bobryan	furq, that's for the conn disconnection
2015-05-09 21:16:27	LadyAlissa	You don't need to do "function() sendData() end" though
2015-05-09 21:16:31	LadyAlissa	You can simply just pass sendData

2015-05-09 21:17:28	furq	not sendData(), sendData
2015-05-09 21:17:30	cmtptr	it doesn't "work too"

2015-05-09 21:17:40	furq	sendData() would pass the result of calling sendData
2015-05-09 21:17:55	furq	sendData passes the function itself
2015-05-09 21:18:39	furq	this is tangential to the main problem though

So I ran the C one which gave the result 49.66s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 49.821 total, and then the lua version with luajit, and the result was 622.35s user 0.92s system 99% cpu 10:24.11 total

2015-05-09 21:47:39	furq	it's still marginally faster to cache them
2015-05-09 21:47:42	cmtptr	how does it do that when they can change
2015-05-09 21:47:52	furq	because it checks whether or not they change
2015-05-09 21:47:55	BitPuffin|osx	furq: pretty sure luajit inlines that if they don't change
2015-05-09 21:48:06	furq	it will hoist them but not until after a few iterations afaik
2015-05-09 21:48:19	BitPuffin|osx	well I did this with 1000 iterations
2015-05-09 21:48:27	furq	like i said, marginally faster

2015-05-09 21:50:05	BitPuffin|osx	part of the point of the benchmark is that it should see how well the language fares in its typical style and not doing excessive optimizations 
2015-05-09 21:50:15	BitPuffin|osx	otherwise you'd probably end up about as verbose code as C

2015-05-09 21:57:44	xyzzy_	in fact, iirc one of the problems luajit has with minilight is that some parts of the code have shitloads of locals in scope at once, which the register allocator doesn't like. ironically using vectors would probably help since you could cut down on locals and allocation sinking could eliminate the allocations

2015-05-10 00:13:36	BitPuffin|osx	xyzzy_: does luajit not like when you do if bla and bleh then return end ?
2015-05-10 00:13:50	BitPuffin|osx	or what does that have to do with coalescing
2015-05-10 00:14:00	BitPuffin|osx	because it's pointing out those as having too complex coalescing
2015-05-10 00:14:11	BitPuffin|osx	like
2015-05-10 00:14:12	BitPuffin|osx	if (v < 0) or (u + v > 1) then return end
2015-05-10 00:15:15	xyzzy_	no it's probably just because of there being a lot of live locals at that point and it hits some limit
2015-05-10 00:16:15	BitPuffin|osx	well hmm I did reduce the amount of locals by quite a margin
2015-05-10 00:16:29	BitPuffin|osx	there was a lot of local ax, ay, az = 1, 2, 3 type stuff
2015-05-10 00:16:39	BitPuffin|osx	which I changed to local a = { 1, 2, 3 }
2015-05-10 00:16:47	BitPuffin|osx	and then ax -> a[1] etc
2015-05-10 00:17:44	BitPuffin|osx	this is the function https://gist.github.com/BitPuffin/286136dc773663ac76e0
2015-05-10 00:18:55	BitPuffin|osx	there are 10 locals

2015-05-10 00:24:42	xyzzy_	ok i found a better explanation from mike about what causes it http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2011-02/msg01284.html
2015-05-10 00:24:42	xyzzy_	that failure is indeed in a side trace
2015-05-10 00:24:56	xyzzy_	so yeah... keep stomping out locals i guess ;)
2015-05-10 00:25:02	BitPuffin|osx	well no
2015-05-10 00:25:24	BitPuffin|osx	the way I was reducing locals almost doubled the amount of reports of coalescing too complex
2015-05-10 00:25:31	BitPuffin|osx	737 without modification
2015-05-10 00:26:03	BitPuffin|osx	actually more than doubled
2015-05-10 00:26:09	BitPuffin|osx	2164
2015-05-10 00:26:18	BitPuffin|osx	so that's only making things a lot worse :P
2015-05-10 00:27:27	xyzzy_	it's possible that by reducing them, it was able to attempt jitting more code which then failed from the same issue
2015-05-10 00:27:50	BitPuffin|osx	strange
2015-05-10 00:29:57	xyzzy_	-jdump=+a contains http://pastebin.com/4tFWNSrg so there are definitely a lot of live locals getting seen

2015-05-10 00:35:33	xyzzy_	since inlining is basically a side-effect of their optimization

2015-05-10 00:54:21	BitPuffin|osx	I wanna see it truly jit

2015-05-10 01:22:55	BitPuffin|osx	well I meant more like disable that specific optimization entirely
2015-05-10 01:22:56	xyzzy_	plus that would make the problem worse
2015-05-10 01:23:03	furq	you can disable it with -joff

2015-05-10 01:24:47	BitPuffin|osx	basically nag him that this ruins the benchmark completely :P
2015-05-10 01:24:57	furq	i expect he'll drop everything

2015-05-10 01:25:42	BitPuffin|osx	he'll buy one

2015-05-10 01:26:17	furq	yeah you tell him Neffi
2015-05-10 01:26:22	xyzzy_	yeah if he had that much money i'd hope he'd be working on the new gc instead
2015-05-10 01:26:26	xyzzy_	or hyperblock scheduling
2015-05-10 01:26:27	Neffiphone	OK furq I will do that

2015-05-10 01:28:25	Neffiphone	as opposed to nothing, yes, thas preferable
2015-05-10 01:29:09	BitPuffin|osx	maybe I should write something more gamey to benchmark with like a physics simulation or something

2015-05-10 15:09:52	bone	who knows, maybe you'll discover some interesting data points and share them with us. ;)
2015-05-10 15:10:07	BitPuffin|osx	I was just wondering if anyone knew if all the terra libraries and luajit libraries are statically linked to the terra executable
2015-05-10 15:10:33	bone	let's see.
2015-05-10 15:10:59	bone	seems like they're dlls on the x86 windows version.
2015-05-10 15:11:07	BitPuffin|osx	I'm on osx here 
2015-05-10 15:11:08	BitPuffin|osx	but hm
2015-05-10 15:11:11	BitPuffin|osx	yeah there is a .so
2015-05-10 15:11:18	BitPuffin|osx	and I'm looking at the makefile
2015-05-10 15:11:31	BitPuffin|osx	it seems to only link the EXEOBJS
2015-05-10 15:12:02	bone	i've been curious about terra as well, but julia shares similar syntax and is also a bit interesting.
2015-05-10 15:12:24	BitPuffin|osx	I'm not sure julia lets you do low level thingies though
2015-05-10 15:12:30	BitPuffin|osx	which is the main reason I was interested in terra
2015-05-10 15:12:39	bone	yeah, it's more like a medium level language.
2015-05-10 15:12:44	BitPuffin|osx	but then I saw that it has pretty damn nice metaprogramming features too
2015-05-10 15:12:50	BitPuffin|osx	so now I'm pretty much decided that I'm gonna use it :P
2015-05-10 15:13:02	bone	heh.
2015-05-10 15:13:19	BitPuffin|osx	oddly enough the terra executable and libterra.so is the same size

2015-05-10 15:27:38	BitPuffin|osx	nah it's not
2015-05-10 15:29:31	_abc_	Is it sufficient to edit src/luaconf.h macros for float real conversion and largest aligned union types to make sure compiled lua will compile without -lm? Does anyone have a patched luaconf.h for 5.1.5 which does this?

2015-05-10 17:38:26	roboo	hey guys how to parse last filename from path? but if it contains _ or .?
2015-05-10 17:39:59	Textmode	?
2015-05-10 17:40:59	cmtptr	nforce100, local n, t = 0, {} for l in io.lines(filename) do local name, fish, weight = l:match("(%S+)%s+(%S+)%s+(%S+)") if playername then n = n + 1 t[n] = {name = name, fish = fish, weight = weight} end end
2015-05-10 17:41:41	cmtptr	at the end of that, t will be an array where each element is a table with the fields name, fish, and weight
2015-05-10 17:42:10	nforce100	thx :D
2015-05-10 17:42:17	LadyAlissa	uhm
2015-05-10 17:42:27	LadyAlissa	cmtptr: "if playername then" shouldn't that be just name?
2015-05-10 17:49:48	cmtptr	yeah
2015-05-10 17:49:49	cmtptr	thx
2015-05-10 17:49:56	cmtptr	nforce100, ^
2015-05-10 17:55:47	nforce100	thx :)
2015-05-10 17:57:42	nforce100	means at the end the array i get looks like t = { {name = "john", fish = "forelle", weight = 5"} ...
2015-05-10 17:59:38	cmtptr	yes
2015-05-10 17:59:47	nforce100	perfect :D

2015-05-10 19:04:12	LadyAlissa	"^(.+)/.-$" would be a proper pattern, if so.

2015-05-10 19:07:55	roboo	that will be the path string
2015-05-10 19:08:29	cmtptr	_abc_, - is non-greedy 0 or more

2015-05-10 22:43:02	furq	and quite possibly the best tommy lee jones film
2015-05-10 22:43:12	cmtptr	I doubt that last one verry much
2015-05-10 22:43:52	furq	under siege, no country for old men, the fugitive, men in black

2015-05-10 22:44:50	cmtptr	where harrison ford is played by wesley snipes

2015-05-11 23:23:31	technomancy	LadyAlissa: yeah that works fine if that's what you like; I was specifically looking for apply from lisp
2015-05-11 23:23:58	technomancy	but I guess if you have unpack you achieve the same effect from a different direction, which gets the job done nicely
2015-05-11 23:24:09	LadyAlissa	If you don't mind me asking, what is "apply" supposed to do?
2015-05-11 23:24:30	furq	the same thing as f(unpack(t))
2015-05-11 23:25:00	technomancy	apply(+, 1, 2, {3, 4}) becomes +(1, 2, 3, 4)

2015-05-11 23:25:15	Neffiphone	lua isn't lisp
2015-05-11 23:25:15	furq	he's not
2015-05-11 23:25:21	technomancy	err; I guess that's a bad example since you can't call + like that
2015-05-11 23:25:26	furq	he wanted to know what the equivalent of apply was in lua
2015-05-11 23:25:29	furq	it's f(unpack(t))

2015-05-11 23:29:21	technomancy	not a bad policy
2015-05-11 23:29:29	Neffiphone	;)
2015-05-11 23:29:36	furq	js is exactly the same as scheme because they have first class functions and i have never used scheme
2015-05-11 23:29:58	technomancy	Neffiphone: it's a common (annoying) trope; when people "discover" that scheme is a subset of JS (except for the homoiconicity and continuations and numeric tower) and get all excited
2015-05-11 23:30:37	LadyAlissa	is there a way to add on to the package path instead of setting LUA_(C?)PATH ? preferably in bash?
2015-05-11 23:30:40	Neffiphone	I don't know scheme /shrug
2015-05-11 23:30:53	furq	"preferably in bash" set LUA_CPATH
2015-05-11 23:31:01	furq	whatever reason you have for not wanting to set it is probably wrong
2015-05-11 23:31:04	Neffiphone	LadyAlissa LUA_PATH
2015-05-11 23:31:13	Neffiphone	the manual states this
2015-05-11 23:31:17	LadyAlissa	but doesn't that completely override package.c?path ?
2015-05-11 23:31:22	furq	no
2015-05-11 23:31:24	Neffiphone	yes
2015-05-11 23:31:35	Neffiphone	see the manual

2015-05-11 23:31:56	xyzzy_	but... callbacks! IIFEs!
2015-05-11 23:32:00	Neffiphone	I think you add ;; at the front which expands to the default value
2015-05-11 23:32:21	xyzzy_	;; makes me ;;

2015-05-11 23:33:52	furq	no i mean like disgust vomiting due to thoughts of a trash man

2015-05-12 23:38:40	technomancy	I'm playing around with the idea of embedding a toy multi-user OS in a game in order to teach programming and unix to kids. I'm starting to wonder if such a thing is possible in lua, since there doesn't appear to be any pre-emptive concurrency.
2015-05-12 23:39:19	technomancy	it appears to be easy to sandbox lua code in terms of what it can access, but I can't find any way to limit it in terms of the amount of time it's allowed to take

2015-05-12 23:41:46	cmtptr	furq, even if he's writing it in c or whatever, how is he going to force a coroutine to yield?
2015-05-12 23:41:48	lenny	I'm currently using it for a twitch.tv bot and for making games. I think you can really use lua for everything.
2015-05-12 23:42:57	technomancy	computercraft supports it, but I think that's because they're using the JVM implementation of lua

2015-05-12 23:44:16	furq	you need to run it from within the same lua_State which is already busy
2015-05-12 23:44:43	cmtptr	can you yield from a debug hook?
2015-05-12 23:44:45	furq	unless this is some function i've never heard of
2015-05-12 23:45:26	technomancy	can you spin up another lua vm from lua code?
2015-05-12 23:45:34	furq	no
2015-05-12 23:45:39	technomancy	welp ._.
2015-05-12 23:45:51	furq	you can do it with luajit+ffi
2015-05-12 23:46:05	furq	although i'd only recommend that if you have no way of modifying the host engine
2015-05-12 23:46:13	cmtptr	you could just not give them preemptive scheduling
2015-05-12 23:46:37	cmtptr	is that really something you need for this?
2015-05-12 23:47:07	cmtptr	especially if it's for teaching kids or whatever, I'd say KISS
2015-05-12 23:47:19	cmtptr	preemptive multitasking is the polar opposite of simple
2015-05-12 23:47:28	technomancy	cmtptr: the terminal which is used to display the output of the programs is written in lua
2015-05-12 23:47:47	technomancy	so if it can't run at the same time as the user programs, they can't see any output
2015-05-12 23:48:02	cmtptr	so you hide yields in an API

2015-05-12 23:49:34	technomancy	there's no way to prevent an infinite loop, and there's no way to end an infinite loop once it's started without stopping the whole server for everyone
2015-05-12 23:49:47	technomancy	if it's being used by kids it needs to be forgiving of mistakes
2015-05-12 23:49:56	cmtptr	that's the very badly part I was talking about
2015-05-12 23:50:06	cmtptr	you can't depend on lua for that
2015-05-12 23:50:18	cmtptr	that shit needs to be boxed outside from c
2015-05-12 23:50:36	furq	yeah if you're depending on the ingame lua api then i doubt this will work
2015-05-12 23:50:45	furq	+exclusively
2015-05-12 23:50:50	technomancy	oh well... it was fun while it lasted
2015-05-12 23:51:10	furq	it would be trivial if you could modify the engine, but i expect you already know that
2015-05-12 23:53:09	technomancy	furq: trivial?
2015-05-12 23:53:32	technomancy	I could try to convince the engine's authors to support it, but that seems really unlikely unless it really is trivial, which I have a hard time believing
2015-05-12 23:53:56	cmtptr	it might already be there and you just don't know it
2015-05-12 23:54:09	furq	it wouldn't be very complicated but it would be very much special-case
2015-05-12 23:54:36	technomancy	you mean specifically the "kill any coroutine that goes over its allotted time limit?" functionality?
2015-05-12 23:54:58	cmtptr	it wouldn't be a coroutine, it would be an entire lua vm
2015-05-12 23:55:01	furq	^
2015-05-12 23:55:16	furq	you'd run multiple VMs in OS threads
2015-05-12 23:55:28	furq	with some kind of message passing
2015-05-12 23:55:36	technomancy	switching from one VM to multiple VMs doesn't seem trivial

2015-05-12 23:58:22	Lappy	multiple lua states is just multiple VMs

2015-05-13 00:21:22	furq	i meant the line after "no"
2015-05-13 00:21:35	cmtptr	scheduler.wait(t, tag) just puts your thread in a table subscribers[tag] = coroutine.running()

2015-05-13 11:27:53	mniip	yes
2015-05-13 11:27:55	mniip	this is dog
2015-05-13 11:28:14	mniip	"method internal to the lua interpreter"
2015-05-13 11:28:16	mniip	what do you mean
2015-05-13 11:28:32	ttmrichter	Beginning with "what is this method thing?"
2015-05-13 11:28:51	tony123	what i mean is define a variable as actual LUA source code and use its content to override an internal method
2015-05-13 11:29:21	ttmrichter	Repeating things in exactly the same words when people express confusion is not a helpful strategy.
2015-05-13 11:29:31	ttmrichter	Generally clarification involves using different, more explanatory, words.
2015-05-13 11:29:37	mniip	also stop saying "LUA"
2015-05-13 11:29:42	mniip	unless you mean the actual joke language
2015-05-13 11:30:16	tony123	i am sorry mates but i am just starting with this interesting language. I do not know the jargon very well , yet. 
2015-05-13 11:30:45	ttmrichter	Well, for starters "method" is not a thing.  Lua has functions, though.  These are like methods without the suction.
2015-05-13 11:30:47	tony123	So please forgive me for any misappropriate use of the LUA word. Alternatively instruct me how to avoid this problem
2015-05-13 11:30:58	mniip	lua is not an acronym, it's a proper portuguese noun
2015-05-13 11:30:59	ttmrichter	You could call it Lua?
2015-05-13 11:31:09	tony123	alright, roger that. 
2015-05-13 11:31:15	Kinnison	Just like Python is not an acronym

2015-05-13 11:31:36	Kinnison	or Sausages
2015-05-13 11:31:40	ttmrichter	That's for confusing things.
2015-05-13 11:32:09	doub	Perl people are as pedantic about it as we are
2015-05-13 11:32:13	tony123	Now, back to the original question. I am dumping the content of the _G table and having a look to its content. I do see some pcall functions defined in it. I would like to know if those values are actual source code, pointers to memory, or ? 
2015-05-13 11:32:29	Kinnison	I see
2015-05-13 11:32:36	mniip	doub, practical extraction and regex language?
2015-05-13 11:32:45	Kinnison	if the debug library is available to you, then you can get some rudimentary information about the stuff in _G
2015-05-13 11:32:51	zash	mniip: report*
2015-05-13 11:32:53	ttmrichter	tony123: The actual values are whatever the implementation represents the value as.
2015-05-13 11:33:03	Kinnison	tony123: But it's not uncommon to wrapper stuff
2015-05-13 11:33:06	ttmrichter	They are opaque.
2015-05-13 11:33:29	mniip	tony123, the default interpreter is written in C, you can't "modify" the "source" of that
2015-05-13 11:33:38	<--	lKinx (~lKinx@76.126.31.163) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2015-05-13 11:33:40	ttmrichter	The "value" of a table is a table.  Its representation is a hex number which may be a pointer to the table.  Or the handle to it in some larger data structure.
2015-05-13 11:33:58	mniip	tony123, pcall is a standard function, which does a rather boring task
2015-05-13 11:34:08	ttmrichter	Or, for all we know, the actual literal ASCII text of that table.
2015-05-13 11:34:08	mniip	%?pcall
2015-05-13 11:34:14	doub	tony123: what do you mean by "some pcall functions" (<= note the s in functions)?
2015-05-13 11:34:16	mniip	%? pcall
2015-05-13 11:34:17	yalb	mniip: http://lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#pdf-pcall
2015-05-13 11:34:21	ttmrichter	Ditto for functions, userdata, etc.
2015-05-13 11:34:33	tony123	Ok, so for example. Can i define a new function dynamically through the Globals table, that is what i meant with "reflection" initially, improperly perhaps
2015-05-13 11:34:51	mniip	you can override standard functions, yes
2015-05-13 11:34:59	ttmrichter	When you define a new function, unless you specify otherwise it by default goes into the Globals table.
2015-05-13 11:35:00	mniip	that's not reflection, no
2015-05-13 11:35:34	tony123	but for example, can i override a function that belongs to the standard interpreter sandbox ?
2015-05-13 11:35:43	ttmrichter	And since variables are no their contents, you can "overwrite" an existing function because all you're really doing is changing what value is bound to the variable.
2015-05-13 11:35:58	doub	tony123: global functions are just global variables with a value of type "function"
2015-05-13 11:36:03	ttmrichter	You cannot override a function at all.  You can change what a variable is boudn to.
2015-05-13 11:36:12	doub	if you can change the value of a global variable, you can replace a function with another
2015-05-13 11:36:48	mniip	you can't change what the function value is, but you can change what _G.pcall and thus pcall points to

2015-05-13 11:57:23	tony123	so, you are aware that the dofile method can be used to enumerate files. 
2015-05-13 11:57:36	ttmrichter	There is no dofile method.
2015-05-13 11:57:45	mniip	once you want your sandbox to be fancy you are pretty much fucked
2015-05-13 11:58:01	mniip	tony123, you mean list files in a directory?
2015-05-13 11:58:10	tony123	you are correct. It may be native of the said vulnerable implementation i am looking at
2015-05-13 11:58:26	tony123	list files in a directory yes. Confirm their existence or not. 
2015-05-13 11:58:48	mniip	"confirm their existence" is so different from "list files"
2015-05-13 11:59:00	tony123	yes, you cannot list files at all. 
2015-05-13 11:59:16	q66	so first you say you can list files
2015-05-13 11:59:20	q66	now you say you cannot list files at all
2015-05-13 11:59:22	q66	make up your mind finally
2015-05-13 11:59:34	tony123	I have corrected mniip i was not confirming that.

2015-05-13 12:09:15	tony123	i see no fopen or the likes
2015-05-13 12:09:22	ttmrichter	We're talking pretty much C Programming 101 here.
2015-05-13 12:09:54	tony123	Indeed, just point me out to where i can see the actual IO, like there is an fopen or something ? 
2015-05-13 12:10:10	bone	there is a call to fopen inside the luaL_loadfile function.

2015-05-13 19:42:20	darkstalker	yes
2015-05-13 19:42:24	bone	his sandbox isn't lua based, it is ptrace based, so the fact that you can run C code makes the .so idea kind of pointless.
2015-05-13 19:42:56	darkstalker	but probably can run arbitrary C code with this method

2015-05-13 19:43:37	bone	really? that's weak.  i did it on my old compiler bot.
2015-05-13 19:43:42	darkstalker	the idea is writing out a compiled binary
2015-05-13 19:43:45	darkstalker	then requiring it
2015-05-13 19:43:47	cmtptr	yeah ^
2015-05-13 19:43:51	bone	right.
2015-05-13 19:44:02	cmtptr	I mean
2015-05-13 19:44:09	cmtptr	I guess you could also do that with c
2015-05-13 19:44:12	bone	okay, well i figured his %c function would be more useful, if you can't include headers that almost makes it pointless to include that.
2015-05-13 19:44:16	cmtptr	put the asm in a string and jump to it
2015-05-13 19:44:19	darkstalker	that binary can pull other libs and do fun stuff

2015-05-13 21:30:59	cmtptr	what also sucks for you is that the lua devs don't take patches from the public
2015-05-13 21:31:13	Neffiphone	lua doesn't really take contributions much
2015-05-13 21:31:21	Neffiphone	or at all

2015-05-13 21:32:06	cmtptr	then why are you asking us and not talking to roberto on his cell phone?
2015-05-13 21:32:11	bone	you can post problems on the mailing list with recommended solutions, and the authors will sometimes consider them.
2015-05-13 21:32:12	Neffiphone	well good luck  ;)
2015-05-13 21:32:24	bone	or make them available as a patch.
2015-05-13 21:32:32	Neffiphone	but they will write the code, not take yours
2015-05-13 21:32:40	bone	more or less.
2015-05-13 21:32:54	cmtptr	change all the variable names to x, y, and z
2015-05-13 21:33:05	Neffiphone	I think they probably want to avoid license restrictions or people owning parts of the code

2015-05-13 21:35:26	dreams	bone: its not that kind of contribution, more like the "published-papers" sort (which could be then adapted to the original implementation).
2015-05-13 21:35:50	bone	sure, i believe the avenue would probably be the same, or you could go direct.
2015-05-13 21:36:08	bone	depending if you wanted to solicit discussion or not.
2015-05-13 21:38:19	dreams	bone: how is it the same?

2015-05-14 23:01:19	Rena	man, after using Lua so much, Python seems so alien.
2015-05-14 23:01:34	Rena	x.a means different than x['a']; (x) means different from (x,)

2015-05-14 23:02:24	cmtptr	and    means different than        !!!
2015-05-14 23:02:31	darkstalker	^
2015-05-14 23:02:53	Rena	heh
2015-05-14 23:02:55	ttmrichter	cmtptr: But only at the beginning of a line for maximal confusion.
2015-05-14 23:03:12	Rena	yeah the indentation thing has bit me a couple times
2015-05-14 23:03:31	Rena	especially I'm still unsure when I can break a line without a backslash
2015-05-14 23:04:16	daurnimator	q66: huh? tabs for indent is normal
2015-05-14 23:04:36	daurnimator	I think lua developers are pretty good about using tabs
2015-05-14 23:04:43	daurnimator	(I rarely see space indented code)
2015-05-14 23:04:53	daurnimator	usually only if they've previously come from python
2015-05-14 23:05:13	ttmrichter	I use spaces for indentation for pretty much any language.
2015-05-14 23:05:25	darkstalker	those who use tabs probably are roblox developers
2015-05-14 23:05:50	cmtptr	I use tabs and I've never even met robert loxley
2015-05-14 23:06:00	Rena	I use tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment, but then people argue about tab width
2015-05-14 23:06:20	ttmrichter	See you get rid of all tab width arguments if you use spaces.
2015-05-14 23:06:22	Rena	in Python it's mostly only a problem if I'm editing a script that uses spaces
2015-05-14 23:06:27	daurnimator	Rena: that's how it should be :)
2015-05-14 23:06:29	Rena	but how many spaces do you use ;)
2015-05-14 23:06:39	aquanight	20:06:23/D6788 < ttmrichter> See you get rid of all tab width arguments if you use spaces. <- um no
2015-05-14 23:06:44	Rena	in Lua of course it's not a problem except for the code maybe being ugly
2015-05-14 23:06:45	daurnimator	tab width is a personal setting in your editor. you don't need to agree on it
2015-05-14 23:06:47	aquanight	you get rid of all tab width arguments if you use tabs
2015-05-14 23:06:54	darkstalker	if i make a language, an isolated tab will be a syntax error
2015-05-14 23:06:54	aquanight	because then you can set the fucking tab stops in your editor
2015-05-14 23:07:20	 *	ttmrichter is always amused at the nerdrage of X vs. Y in programming.  :)
2015-05-14 23:07:41	daurnimator	ttmrichter: keeps us busy from contemplating our own mortality
2015-05-14 23:07:42	aquanight	ttmrichter: bonus points for when there's a viable solution that makes everyone happy
2015-05-14 23:07:43	Rena	well that doesn't totally solve it, because then you have code written by someone else with a different tab width, so the lines are different lengths on your screen
2015-05-14 23:07:56	Rena	(or by some clown who uses tabs for alignment as well)
2015-05-14 23:07:59	daurnimator	Rena: who cares what the line length is?
2015-05-14 23:08:13	aquanight	I don't believe in wrapping lines at some arbitrary fixed length
2015-05-14 23:08:20	aquanight	wrap it at a logical place if you think it needs wrapping
2015-05-14 23:08:24	aquanight	or else just don't wrap it
2015-05-14 23:08:25	Rena	well I always try to keep my lines under 80 columns, just for neatness
2015-05-14 23:08:28	daurnimator	^^
2015-05-14 23:08:33	daurnimator	(to aquanight )
2015-05-14 23:08:38	Rena	(and I can fit 3 80-column editor panes on my screen nicely)
2015-05-14 23:08:40	darkstalker	if you aligns things with spaces after tabs, then a different tab width will look bad
2015-05-14 23:08:45	aquanight	80 columns = are we in the 1980s again?
2015-05-14 23:08:50	daurnimator	I can fit 6 200 column panes on my screen....
2015-05-14 23:08:58	cmtptr	aquanight, omfg I hope so
2015-05-14 23:08:59	aquanight	darkstalker: .... no they won't?
2015-05-14 23:09:00	Rena	at 1pt font?
2015-05-14 23:09:15	cmtptr	furq remember the 80s?
2015-05-14 23:09:15	aquanight	darkstalker: if you align you match tabs with the previous line and then space the rest
2015-05-14 23:09:20	daurnimator	Rena: 3 monitors side by side :)
2015-05-14 23:09:22	aquanight	then if tabstop changes both lines change equally
2015-05-14 23:09:23	Rena	I meant horizontally tiled btw
2015-05-14 23:09:25	Rena	heh
2015-05-14 23:09:29	daurnimator	Rena: (4k)
2015-05-14 23:09:55	Rena	I guess it can still be an issue if the lines are indented by different amounts
2015-05-14 23:10:15	daurnimator	hell, I can fit 16 if I wanted to
2015-05-14 23:10:19	aquanight	if your indent pattern wasn't designed by a 4-year-old you won't have a problem with using hard-tabs to indent
2015-05-14 23:10:20	Rena	if one line has two tabs and the next has three and then you use spaces to align some columns, it won't work with different tab width
2015-05-14 23:10:27	Rena	but I can't think of when I'd want to do that
2015-05-14 23:10:39	aquanight	Rena: you wouldn't align in two lines with different indents
2015-05-14 23:10:46	cmtptr	I'm going to make a language where indenting will be a syntax error
2015-05-14 23:10:48	aquanight	because an indent means you're in a block, so why would you align

2015-05-14 23:11:15	Rena	obviously the real solution is that all editors should implement elastic tabstops so that everything is nicely indented and aligned no matter what your settings. :p

2015-05-14 23:11:42	ttmrichter	It's not a debate.  It's an argument.

2015-05-14 23:13:12	daurnimator	Rena: I generally don't align anyway. it makes for bad diffs
2015-05-14 23:13:24	aquanight	Rena: why the actual fuck do they have nonfixed font?
2015-05-14 23:13:25	Rena	that's also a valid point
2015-05-14 23:13:36	Rena	I hope it's only to demonstrate
2015-05-14 23:13:52	aquanight	I mean, I guess nothing against nonfixed fonts really
2015-05-14 23:13:59	aquanight	a font is a font and there's really nothing special about nonfixed
2015-05-14 23:14:09	daurnimator	I used to use comic sans for IRC :P
2015-05-14 23:14:10	aquanight	but using nonfixed to demonstrate alignment is probably not the way to do it
2015-05-14 23:14:23	Rena	code, terminals and IRC are places where you really should be using fixed width
2015-05-14 23:14:36	Rena	but whatever floats your goat
2015-05-14 23:14:37	aquanight	in my case, the last two overlap
2015-05-14 23:14:39	daurnimator	o.o I'm actually not using fixed width for IRC right now
2015-05-14 23:14:43	aquanight	yay for irssi/cgwin :/

2015-05-14 23:15:44	Rena	yeah. I remember seeing some Windows malware using names like rundII32.exe
2015-05-14 23:15:45	daurnimator	aquanight: I thought the cardinal sin was bad keming
2015-05-14 23:16:09	darkstalker	the ultimate cardinal sin is taking selfies
2015-05-14 23:16:09	aquanight	daurnimator: nice try, but kerning is a nonissue with fixed-fonts on a terminal
2015-05-14 23:16:41	aquanight	in fact I would dare to say that kerning is only an issue on nonfixed
2015-05-14 23:16:50	Rena	or scam sites with names like mlcrosoft.com

2015-05-14 23:40:32	aquanight	so either enjoy juggling a bunch of Task objects or your code is littered with async
2015-05-14 23:40:35	aquanight	er
2015-05-14 23:40:37	aquanight	well async and await
2015-05-14 23:40:42	aquanight	daurnimator: I can give it a shot
2015-05-14 23:40:52	daurnimator	aquanight: I'd like to port cqueues to windows.... https://github.com/wahern/cqueues/issues/35
2015-05-14 23:41:33	daurnimator	I've spent a few late evenings trying to figure out how low level windows programming works
2015-05-14 23:41:38	daurnimator	it's all very undocumented

2015-05-14 23:42:12	bone	depends on how low you go.  most of the win32 stuff is fairly well documented on msdn.

2015-05-14 23:42:35	daurnimator	finally figuring out AFD was sort of fun: https://gist.github.com/daurnimator/63d2970aedc952f0beb3

2015-05-14 23:42:46	aquanight	darkstalker: uh yes?
2015-05-14 23:42:47	bone	yeah, it's a stupid name.
2015-05-14 23:43:00	aquanight	darkstalker: not much of the API changes for 64-bit, other than the size of HANDLE (and derivatives)
2015-05-14 23:43:14	bone	even better is how 32-bit binaries are placed on win64...
2015-05-14 23:43:16	daurnimator	bone: AFD is what's used internally by select/WSAAsyncSelect/etc.
2015-05-14 23:43:20	aquanight	darkstalker: for fucks sakes, the DLL is still called kernel32!!
2015-05-14 23:43:51	bone	daurnimator: did you investigate how libuv works on windows?
2015-05-14 23:43:58	bone	iirc, io completion ports.
2015-05-14 23:44:03	daurnimator	bone: yeah, it uses it. I talked to the guy that wrote it :)
2015-05-14 23:44:13	aquanight	(and instead we got the joy that is %windir%\syswow64 and file virtualization to make the joy that is the \system32 \syswow64 and \sysnative trifecta of FUCK THIS)
2015-05-14 23:44:25	bone	what is wrong with that approach? it doesn't rely on undocumented stuff.
2015-05-14 23:44:30	darkstalker	is there a free version of VS that can be used for open source?
2015-05-14 23:44:36	daurnimator	bone: IOCP aren't stackable btw, so they're not great
2015-05-14 23:44:43	aquanight	darkstalker: yes!
2015-05-14 23:44:53	daurnimator	bone: also you can only associate one per HANDLE (they're actually stored IN the handle)
2015-05-14 23:44:54	darkstalker	someday i want to bootstrap Lua there and see if i can run my gtk apps there
2015-05-14 23:44:57	Rena	ahh Windows
2015-05-14 23:45:00	aquanight	I think the newest VS is pretty much pro-level and free
2015-05-14 23:45:12	daurnimator	bone: not only that, but if you turn off notification for HANDLES they go much faster
2015-05-14 23:45:21	aquanight	daurnimator: the thing about IOCP is they only work on sockets
2015-05-14 23:45:31	daurnimator	aquanight: IOCP works on lots of things
2015-05-14 23:45:32	aquanight	most wait APIs I've seen like epoll/kqueue/etc work on any kind of FD
2015-05-14 23:45:38	aquanight	oh does it?
2015-05-14 23:45:45	aquanight	I admit I'm not as familiar with IOCP
2015-05-14 23:45:46	daurnimator	AFD is the best thing. but it only works for TCP and UDP
2015-05-14 23:46:16	daurnimator	I'm thinking I might just do a self-pipe over AFD though to reunite it all
2015-05-14 23:46:21	aquanight	if only .NET had an interface into IOCP
2015-05-14 23:47:02	aquanight	also if you want to see a place of bad documentation in the msdn
2015-05-14 23:47:10	aquanight	look at the winspool.drv documentations

2015-05-14 23:47:35	daurnimator	aquanight: so.. care to help out? :)
2015-05-14 23:47:50	daurnimator	the hope is to cover up all the horribleness and use cqueues as a cross platform base
2015-05-14 23:47:50	aquanight	daurnimator: I admit I'm less familiar with the low-level parts
2015-05-14 23:48:07	aquanight	and I don't really understand what cqueue even is
2015-05-14 23:48:34	daurnimator	aquanight: coroutine based framework for lua. IMO the only one that does it 'right'
2015-05-14 23:49:29	daurnimator	aquanight: includes coroutine scheduler, socket lib, dns lib, signal handling, threading basics, etc.

2015-05-14 23:49:51	aquanight	hrm
2015-05-14 23:49:54	daurnimator	aquanight: unlike almost all the other ones, cqueues is composable: it fits well into *other* event frameworks.
2015-05-14 23:50:14	darkstalker	does cqueues require an event loop?
2015-05-14 23:50:16	aquanight	I will have to think about this, but for now I probably need to go sleep
2015-05-14 23:50:31	daurnimator	which means you can write a network lib that uses cqueues, but then use it anywhere: inside of prosody, inside of openresty, without anything...
2015-05-14 23:50:42	daurnimator	darkstalker: it has it's own, or you can BYO
2015-05-14 23:51:27	daurnimator	darkstalker: it exposes a file descriptor you can watch for read events, and when it polls ready, you call a function to tell cqueues to do some work.
2015-05-14 23:52:11	daurnimator	so you can integrate it with any other event loop that lets you provide a file descriptor for watching
2015-05-14 23:53:17	darkstalker	yea i remember when we were talking about the curl binding 
2015-05-14 23:53:29	darkstalker	but it didnt bind that method
2015-05-14 23:54:12	darkstalker	the http module on my library is pluggable now, so could write a cqueues impl for it

2015-05-16 14:34:55	Stavros	hello
2015-05-16 14:35:11	Stavros	i want to write a lua script to access cassandra, but i'm not sure how to add packages (i'm using luarocks)
2015-05-16 14:36:37	darkstalker	cassandra is a database thing right?
2015-05-16 14:36:46	Stavros	darkstalker, yeah
2015-05-16 14:37:16	Stavros	the package seems to be requiring the socket module?
2015-05-16 14:37:20	darkstalker	found this https://github.com/jbochi/lua-resty-cassandra
2015-05-16 14:37:37	Stavros	darkstalker, that's what i'm using, but it requires "socket", which isn't installed
2015-05-16 14:37:51	darkstalker	it didnt pull luasocket by itself?
2015-05-16 14:38:10	Stavros	darkstalker, no, it just checked out luarocks (i assume) and it gave me a git message about being in detached head mode
2015-05-16 14:38:37	Stavros	darkstalker, oh, "luarocks install luasocket" worked
2015-05-16 14:38:39	darkstalker	the rockspec has no deps, proably you need to "luarocks install luasocket" too
2015-05-16 14:38:42	darkstalker	yes
2015-05-16 14:38:45	Stavros	thanks
2015-05-16 14:38:50	Stavros	the package seems to work now, thanks

2015-05-16 15:23:38	Stavros	oh hmm
2015-05-16 15:23:42	darkstalker	that looks like a regular lua path
2015-05-16 15:23:54	Stavros	darkstalker, yeah, i think i saw luarocks using 5.1 somewhere, let me look
2015-05-16 15:24:28	Stavros	yeah, luarocks installed it to 5.1
2015-05-16 15:24:32	Stavros	that's odd

2015-05-16 15:25:06	darkstalker	probably your system lua is 5.1,  and powerdns uses 5.2
2015-05-16 15:25:57	Stavros	darkstalker, hmm, apt says that luarocks requires 5.1, so i guess it was built with 5.1 maybe?
2015-05-16 15:26:02	Stavros	is there a way to force it to install in 5.2?
2015-05-16 15:26:21	darkstalker	install from source
2015-05-16 15:26:26	Stavros	aw
2015-05-16 15:26:37	darkstalker	don't know about debian's packages
2015-05-16 15:26:46	darkstalker	maybe there is a luarocks52 thing 
2015-05-16 15:27:11	darkstalker	some distros even package lua with luarocks together
2015-05-16 15:28:16	Stavros	there's no luarocks52 package, sadly, but let me check if luarocks was in 5.2
2015-05-16 15:29:22	darkstalker	btw installing from source isn't messy or painful, since it's lua code

2015-05-17 18:39:01	Tritonio	i guess it's what I said above but I was wondering if it's also something more than that because ephemeron sounds more flashy than just that one thing hehe
2015-05-17 18:39:19	Zarutian	as far as I understand ephermon tables they are meant to resolve cases where something only reachable via the value corrisponding to the key is also referencing the key

2015-05-18 17:13:39	Roguexy	Hi, I have a question. I have a function (lets call it A) that returns 2 values. I have another function (B) that takes 3 arguments. I would like to pass the return values of A to the first 2 arguments of B and add the third arg from another variable. Something like B(A(), "foo"), but this only passes the first value from A() and "foo" as the second arg. What is the recommended way in lua to do this? (lua 5.2)
2015-05-18 17:14:20	cmtptr	rewrite B so that "foo" comes first
2015-05-18 17:14:29	zash	Roguexy: Or local a,b = A(); B(a, b, "foo");
2015-05-18 17:14:32	hoelzro	Roguexy: probably just assign A's results into locals and pass those
2015-05-18 17:15:02	TsT	Roguexy see the 2 lines upper this one

2015-05-18 22:28:18	ttmrichter	darkstalker: Seriously, use something other than SHA-1 or MD5.  SHA-1 is now down to 2^52 operations to break.  DES was ditched because its keys were only 56 bits in length and thus easily broken with commodity hardware.
2015-05-18 22:28:33	darkstalker	it's not my choice. it's the oauth spec
2015-05-18 22:28:52	darkstalker	most people use the hmac-sha1 part
2015-05-18 22:29:02	ttmrichter	At this point SHA-1 is going to be going down that spiral path into "mathematical party trick" where cryptanalysts will generate a collision in their heads for kicks.
2015-05-18 22:29:32	 *	ttmrichter makes a mental note, then, to start backing away from OAuth-"secured" systems.  :)
2015-05-18 22:30:01	darkstalker	it's not plain sha1, it's hmac
2015-05-18 22:32:12	ttmrichter	The strength of an HMAC depends on the strength of the hash.
2015-05-18 22:32:24	ttmrichter	If SHA-1 is broken, any HMAC based on it is broken.
2015-05-18 22:33:09	ttmrichter	A collision attack won't cause problems.
2015-05-18 22:33:20	ttmrichter	But collision attacks are the beginning of the end for hashes.

2015-05-19 16:24:28	cmtptr	so how did you do it?
2015-05-19 16:24:41	xyzzy_	setfenv
2015-05-19 16:25:04	einsteinK	before running the code, running it trough a parser

2015-05-19 16:25:14	einsteinK	determining what's a string, a comment or other code
2015-05-19 16:25:46	einsteinK	with the other code, insert something like SsdfSDsdf behind stuff like 'do', 'repeat', ...
2015-05-19 16:26:01	einsteinK	at beginning of script use local SsdfSDsdf = some function
2015-05-19 16:26:21	einsteinK	I meant inserting SsdfSDsdf() in those loops of course
2015-05-19 16:26:25	xyzzy_	that seems a bit dodgy since like furq said, if you call into c, it can hang, and you can't detect it
2015-05-19 16:26:29	einsteinK	Don't have to care about function calls, stack overflow will solve that
2015-05-19 16:26:44	cmtptr	no it won't
2015-05-19 16:26:47	einsteinK	well, I don't count for C-side stuff going wrong
2015-05-19 16:26:53	cmtptr	oh
2015-05-19 16:27:12	einsteinK	If the C-side is a bit decent about not crashing when called, it should be fine
2015-05-19 16:27:32	cmtptr	what happens if the user code defines a SsdfSDsdf?
2015-05-19 16:27:39	einsteinK	since SsdfSDsdf is a local, you can't detect it without knowing the name (or using string.dump)
2015-05-19 16:27:47	einsteinK	(well, you can use one less local variable though)
2015-05-19 16:28:01	einsteinK	I assume that nobody would ever use the name SsdfSDsdf for a variable
2015-05-19 16:28:08	cmtptr	I use it all the time

2015-05-20 01:15:49	cmtptr	the documentation says that rectangles don't work, but they actually do as far as I can tell and confirmed by some nice guy in #geda with a @ next to his name
2015-05-20 01:15:56	cmtptr	so I thought, hey, why wouldn't polygons also work???

2015-05-20 01:16:41	xyzzy_	the real question is why is cmtptr making designing pcbs

2015-05-20 01:16:54	ttmrichter	Read the FAQ at the bottom for some serious WTFery.
2015-05-20 01:17:01	ttmrichter	Can I have two pads/pins with the same pin-number?
2015-05-20 01:17:03	ttmrichter	“Yes, totally. This is how you create oval shaped copper around pins, or funny shaped pads (e.g. square at one end and round at the other) by overlapping two or more pads.”

2015-05-20 01:18:37	cmtptr	what do they use?  because they're all bad as far as I can tell
2015-05-20 01:18:57	ttmrichter	They are all pretty terrible.  My partners all use Protel, though.
2015-05-20 01:19:18	cmtptr	I don't like the ones that want you to create a unifying project file for everything

2015-05-20 07:24:03	technomancy	anyone know a good alternative?
2015-05-20 07:24:28	doub	use it without a license

2015-05-20 07:25:09	technomancy	I would rather follow the law?
2015-05-20 07:25:35	technomancy	furq: looks promising; thanks. do you know why it states specifically that it's for luajit?
2015-05-20 07:25:45	furq	The library designed in mind of fact that LuaJIT traces tail-, up- and down-recursion and has a lot of byte code optimizations. Lua 5.1-5.3 are also supported.
2015-05-20 07:26:21	technomancy	huh; regular non-jit lua doesn't do TCO?
2015-05-20 07:26:33	furq	it does tco
2015-05-20 07:26:51	technomancy	I'm not familiar with up- and down-recursion; will see if I can read up on it
2015-05-20 07:27:04	technomancy	tl;dr would be that you could blow the stack for large tables on non-luajit?

2015-05-20 07:30:26	technomancy	random unrelated question: I am using the repl from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20410082/why-does-the-lua-repl-require-you-to-prepend-an-equal-sign-in-order-to-get-a-val and I understand it's a huge hack, but I find it a lot more usable than the one you get out of the box
2015-05-20 07:30:38	technomancy	except for the fact that it doesn't print the whole stack trace; just the first line
2015-05-20 07:30:45	technomancy	is there any proper repl I could use?

2015-05-20 07:31:23	technomancy	https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-repl looks promising but it seems to focus on embedding in other programs, which I'm not interested in
2015-05-20 07:31:37	rjek	You can use lua-repl stand alone.
2015-05-20 07:31:39	furq	the one in that SO answer can be fixed to print a full stack trace
2015-05-20 07:31:40	rjek	Or you could just type =
2015-05-20 07:31:56	furq	change pcall(f) to xpcall(f, debug.traceback)
2015-05-20 07:32:19	technomancy	furq: perfect; thanks
2015-05-20 07:32:30	furq	or use lua 5.3's repl which does implicit returns
2015-05-20 07:32:32	technomancy	I am trying to train myself to type = but my brain rebels
2015-05-20 07:32:45	technomancy	furq: oh man.... that makes me very happy to hear, even if I am stuck on 5.1 for this project =)
2015-05-20 07:32:48	furq	you'll get used to it

2015-05-20 07:33:01	profan	furq: nice, it finally might feel like a repl then
2015-05-20 07:33:16	furq	the one annoyance for me is that ^C kills the interpreter if you want to break out of a typo'd statement
2015-05-20 07:33:27	furq	it would be nice if ^C just returned you to a prompt and ^D killed the interpreter
2015-05-20 07:33:32	technomancy	agreed
2015-05-20 07:33:44	furq	we can but dream~
2015-05-20 07:34:15	doub	on windows ^C returns to the prompt
2015-05-20 07:34:20	furq	yesterday i hit ^D in a windows command prompt and got annoyed when it didn't close the window
2015-05-20 07:34:29	furq	stupid bill gates
2015-05-20 07:34:37	technomancy	furq: in erlang hitting ^D just beeps at you no matter what the platform
2015-05-20 07:34:44	technomancy	it's like "you didn't say simon says"
2015-05-20 07:34:50	technomancy	100% infuriating

2015-05-20 07:35:10	profan	oh erlang's repl is always fun to get re-acquainted to every time you leave it for more than a day

2015-05-20 16:28:08	Neppy	hello there~ any good resource for indepth info on how lua handles memory? short of reading the sourcecode of course... specifically wondering due to pondering about memory management in a minecraft mod, which uses lua for scripting on computer that are in the game. primarily  curious about the possiblities of allocating and freeing memory by hand from within lua
2015-05-20 16:28:13	bone	looks like 5.1.
2015-05-20 16:28:15	Neppy	(but within respects to the memory limits each computer has)
2015-05-20 16:28:19	deryni	Why do you need a single library for all three?
2015-05-20 16:28:43	leite	no all three, but crc and md5 will be awesome
2015-05-20 16:29:04	leite	im working on etag
2015-05-20 16:29:18	deryni	Same question. Why care if it is one module or two?
2015-05-20 16:29:20	darkstalker	Neppy: why do you need manual memory allocation?
2015-05-20 16:29:21	deryni	Why does it matter?
2015-05-20 16:29:39	bone	Neppy: the best you've got is collectgarbage()
2015-05-20 16:29:41	Neppy	darkstalker: because, for memory-critical applications, the behavior of the GC is too fluctuating
2015-05-20 16:29:50	Neppy	bone: yeah but thats disabled in the sandbox :<
2015-05-20 16:30:23	darkstalker	i don't think lua has a way of working without gc
2015-05-20 16:30:32	bone	well, you could ask whomever it is in charge of that to expose a function that will only call a full garbage collection cycle.
2015-05-20 16:30:33	darkstalker	unless you work at C level with userdata and stuff
2015-05-20 16:30:48	<--	Negative_Se7en (~ali@5.121.103.143) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2015-05-20 16:30:51	darkstalker	but you can setup the GC so it doesn't trigger "randomly"
2015-05-20 16:30:56	darkstalker	like doing one GC pass every frame
2015-05-20 16:31:02	Neppy	bone: i think the point in disabling it was to prevent people from spamming calls to it and lag the server
2015-05-20 16:31:35	Neffiphone	that doesn't make sense
2015-05-20 16:32:14	Neppy	darkstalker: the mod itself uses native lua stuff, so i suppose it could implement a function to allocate, but theres no way from within lua without it?
2015-05-20 16:32:33	Neffiphone	nope
2015-05-20 16:32:39	darkstalker	i think you should just improve your algorithms
2015-05-20 16:32:49	bone	"native lua stuff" meaning?
2015-05-20 16:32:53	darkstalker	if you don't want unpredictable gc'ing, then make sure your data doesn't get gc'ed
2015-05-20 16:33:00	Neffiphone	write to avoid too much rrbage churn
2015-05-20 16:33:03	Neppy	well it uses lua, either luaj or if available the native lua dlls

2015-05-20 16:33:25	deryni	Disabling collectgarbage isn't the same as disabling the GC.
2015-05-20 16:33:45	Neppy	at the moment im trying to figure what leaves data behind and what doesnt etc, hence why i wonder on memory management info
2015-05-20 16:33:52	deryni	If you are worried about your code using too much memory then profile it and make it use less.
2015-05-20 16:34:14	deryni	New tables, new strings (any string modification), new functions, etc.
2015-05-20 16:34:19	deryni	all allocate memory.
2015-05-20 16:34:45	Neppy	table modification? new functions being new created or called ones? calling doesnt seem to leave memory behind from what i've seen
2015-05-20 16:35:36	bone	calling a function typically won't, unles it is doing something to generate more things.
2015-05-20 16:35:40	deryni	New tables does, adding new fields to tables can, string modifications do, creating functions does. calling a function itself wont'.
2015-05-20 16:35:45	deryni	but the function might.

2015-05-20 16:35:56	Neppy	okay
2015-05-20 16:36:24	Neppy	bit intransparent with java-side functions added into the mix haha, will have to try around i suppose
2015-05-20 16:36:27	deryni	The main "surprising" thing that allocates memory is string modifications/concatenations. lua strings are immutable so they never get modified they get copied.
2015-05-20 16:36:37	Neppy	ah.. hm
2015-05-20 16:36:40	deryni	So creating a string via .. in a loop is relatively costly.

2015-05-20 16:36:57	Neppy	is that why print leaves memory behind?
2015-05-20 16:37:08	Neppy	like print(collectgarbage("collect"))
2015-05-20 16:37:16	furq	only if the arguments weren't already strings
2015-05-20 16:37:25	deryni	print(var..var1..var3) will create a new string for the concat and that will allocate memory.
2015-05-20 16:37:26	furq	print calls tostring on its arguments which creates new strings
2015-05-20 16:37:34	Neppy	oh, rihgt
2015-05-20 16:37:36	Neppy	makes sense
2015-05-20 16:37:37	furq	unless they were already strings
2015-05-20 16:38:08	Neppy	so then the question - to which i guess the answer is no - is, is there a workaround to have strings without having strings? :D

2015-05-20 16:39:03	deryni	Don't create strings you don't need. Use table.concat when you need to build up a string (or use something like lua ropes).

2015-05-20 16:44:59	deryni	How did you install openssl?
2015-05-20 16:46:16	jmares	It must have been preinstalled automatically as a dependency when installing torch dependencies. Either that or mac homebrew did it while installing something else
2015-05-20 16:46:24	Neppy	hm the rope example here http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaRopes seems to create lots of temporary functions though :x isnt that kind of counterproductive

2015-05-20 20:18:48	koz_	I'm a bit confused about how to use checks. I wrote this: http://dpaste.com/1NHTM5Q , but luacheck complains that 'checkers' is a 'non-standard global variable'.
2015-05-20 20:19:07	koz_	The example in check doesn't use the local var = require("checks") form.
2015-05-20 20:19:19	koz_	What should I do here to quieted luacheck *and* have it work?
2015-05-20 20:19:44	Alissa	We have no idea what this "checks" is.

2015-05-20 20:22:04	koz_	Should the checks usage example work even though I've used the 'local var = require("checks") form"?

2015-05-20 20:25:44	furq	setting globals in luaopen_xxx used to be recommended but it's discouraged now
2015-05-20 20:25:49	furq	maybe sierra didn't get the memo

2015-05-20 23:33:34	technomancy	ttmrichter: I understand the motivation for not wanting to consider two mutable objects equal ever; that totally makes sense
2015-05-20 23:33:44	ttmrichter	It's not the mutability thing.
2015-05-20 23:33:48	ttmrichter	It's more one of definitions.
2015-05-20 23:33:57	cmtptr	what happens if they have an index that refers to themselves?  would you consider that equal?
2015-05-20 23:34:16	ttmrichter	If your tables are identical except that one of the keys references two different tables ... with identical contents, are the tables equal?
2015-05-20 23:34:29	ttmrichter	How deep do you go before you say there's inequality?
2015-05-20 23:34:38	technomancy	ttmrichter: there is no sensible answer for mutable tables
2015-05-20 23:34:43	ttmrichter	There's no single answer to that; only application-specific answers.
2015-05-20 23:35:00	technomancy	if they're immutable, then you go by egal
2015-05-20 23:35:08	technomancy	can you make immutable tables with metamethods?
2015-05-20 23:35:20	ttmrichter	Yes.
2015-05-20 23:35:29	ttmrichter	In the sense that you cannot change contents.
2015-05-20 23:35:35	ttmrichter	But that still doesn't solve the problem.
2015-05-20 23:35:47	ttmrichter	Basically the problem is "shallow compare" vs. "deep compare".
2015-05-20 23:36:01	ttmrichter	A variant of nominal vs. structural comparisons in type systems.
2015-05-20 23:36:26	technomancy	actually I think that's pretty well-understood; baker's equality paper covers the subject nicely
2015-05-20 23:36:53	ttmrichter	Baker's equality paper doesn't cover things like tables referencing themselves, IIRC.
2015-05-20 23:37:02	technomancy	you can't have an immutable table reference itself
2015-05-20 23:37:11	ttmrichter	a = { "self" = a }
2015-05-20 23:37:19	ttmrichter	b = { "self" = b }
2015-05-20 23:37:24	ttmrichter	Are these tables the same?
2015-05-20 23:37:32	ttmrichter	Sure you can.
2015-05-20 23:37:52	technomancy	oh, I see. you can't in most languages, but lua plays scoping tricks that makes it possible.
2015-05-20 23:38:08	xyzzy_	ttmrichter: but that syntax is invalid!
2015-05-20 23:38:20	furq	yeah that doesn't work
2015-05-20 23:38:23	ttmrichter	xyzzy_: Probably.  :)
2015-05-20 23:38:25	furq	% local a a = { x = a } print(a.x)
2015-05-20 23:38:26	yalb	furq: nil
2015-05-20 23:38:28	cmtptr	well technically in ttmrichter's example - aside from the invalid syntax - a.self and b.self is nil
2015-05-20 23:38:53	cmtptr	but you can still do what he was demonstrating
2015-05-20 23:38:56	furq	yeah

2015-05-20 23:39:16	technomancy	anyway, I get that lua is an imperative language, so it's mostly an academic question.
2015-05-20 23:39:22	ttmrichter	Right.
2015-05-20 23:39:42	furq	a = {} a.x = a setmetatable(a, make_this_table_immutable_metatable_because_metatables_are_a_cool_hobby)
2015-05-20 23:39:46	ttmrichter	The practical answer is "you can do what you want based on application-specific definitions of what you need".
2015-05-20 23:40:15	furq	remember what the announcer from dangun feveron says
2015-05-20 23:40:19	furq	DO WHAT YOU WANT
2015-05-20 23:40:30	cmtptr	furq, does that work?
2015-05-20 23:40:33	technomancy	hm; according to http://www.lua.org/pil/13.4.2.html the __newindex metamethod won't prevent you from changing existing values
2015-05-20 23:40:36	furq	what, doing what you want?
2015-05-20 23:40:38	furq	sure it does
2015-05-20 23:40:43	cmtptr	the right side should happen before the assignment
2015-05-20 23:40:56	furq	huh
2015-05-20 23:41:13	cmtptr	you set the metatable before assigning to a.x
2015-05-20 23:41:26	furq	but then the assignment will fail
2015-05-20 23:41:47	technomancy	cmtptr: and then once a.x is set, what's to prevent it from changing?
2015-05-20 23:42:09	cmtptr	technomancy, use a proxy table
2015-05-20 23:42:10	furq	also you need a proxy table for that
2015-05-20 23:42:33	technomancy	gotcha
2015-05-20 23:42:35	technomancy	cool, that works
2015-05-20 23:42:59	technomancy	I'm not smart enough to write nontrivial code that works with mutable data structures
2015-05-20 23:43:02	furq	you can put the proxy table in the metatable and then protect the metatable with __metatable
2015-05-20 23:43:09	furq	metatable!
2015-05-20 23:43:25	furq	meattable
2015-05-20 23:43:31	cmtptr	so make all your code trivial
2015-05-20 23:43:39	cmtptr	isn't that ultimately the goal of programming?
2015-05-20 23:43:44	furq	bleatteam
2015-05-20 23:43:45	technomancy	cmtptr: it is a life goal of mine =)

2015-05-20 23:46:12	cmtptr	woah, is she a real person?
2015-05-20 23:46:27	cmtptr	I actually thought she was just a seinfeld character
2015-05-20 23:46:29	furq	did you think she was just a vengeful roadside garbage collector from the simpsons
2015-05-20 23:46:41	furq	damn. i was close

2015-05-21 10:37:17	aquanight	ttmrichter: depending on how it's implemented it either can only expand simple variables (eg "hello $x" but not "hello $x[3]" or "hello $x->name", or it can expand more complex references, but then it becomes less certain how to determine the end point
2015-05-21 10:37:44	aquanight	usually you end up with some kind of ${...} syntax to disambiguate longer/more complex references
2015-05-21 10:37:57	aquanight	which usually ends up getting expanded to allow arbitrary expressions (including function calls!)

2015-05-21 10:38:16	furq	how dare they
2015-05-21 10:38:21	q66	you allow $x for var names and $(x) for expressions
2015-05-21 10:38:22	q66	simple
2015-05-21 10:38:43	q66	+ you make it explicit by not allowing interpolation on default string literal format, but on a special literal format only
2015-05-21 10:38:52	aquanight	hidingin expressions inside a string literal means that unless your editor is really on its game, you don't get any syntax highlighting for it
2015-05-21 10:39:01	q66	my editor has no trouble highlighting it
2015-05-21 10:39:06	q66	and it's not really a special editor
2015-05-21 10:39:10	ttmrichter	q66: I actually favour forcing $(x)  or ${x} or whatever -- delimited -- for all ... precisely because of what aquanight said.

2015-05-21 10:59:58	q66	that's why you can have multiple variants...
2015-05-21 11:00:02	q66	depending on the input amount

2015-05-21 11:13:28	Taoki	Hi. Can anyone please help me with a table code, which I can't figure out how to write? Basically I have multiple tables, and I want to generate a table where each entry in each table pairs with each entry in each other table.
2015-05-21 11:13:31	Taoki	For example: t1 = {"0", "1"} t2 = {"a", "b"} t3 = {"<", ">"} - The result I would want is: mytable = {"0a<", "0a>", "0b<", "0b>", "1a<", "1a>", "1b<", "1b>"}
2015-05-21 11:14:00	Taoki	However there can be any number of tables, such as t4 / t5 / etc. So the code would have to adapt with that.
2015-05-21 11:14:03	Taoki	Is there a way to achieve this?
2015-05-21 11:14:09	cmtptr	yes
2015-05-21 11:14:47	Taoki	That's good. Tried to figure it out and googled for an example, but no luck

2015-05-21 12:52:57	Spacemonkey	I know when I do my code reviews to look out for the assignment part, because the coders may have assumed that they were initialising all 3 variables in one hit. Clearly this would be a bad assumption in certain circumstances. Thats all.

2015-05-21 12:59:20	Spacemonkey	The reality is most people learn to code on the fly, and there are virtually no lua coders in the market. It is a testament to lua that it is so easy to pick up, but not everyone has a degree in programming or interested in how languages are made. At the end of the day a programmer just wants to do their 9-5 then fuck off home.

2015-05-22 00:03:51	cmtptr	so, any unit I want?
2015-05-22 00:03:56	furq	no
2015-05-22 00:04:02	furq	the unit which is used as a distance measurement in quake
2015-05-22 00:04:07	furq	which is called "unit"
2015-05-22 00:04:15	koz_	Can I index ... ?
2015-05-22 00:04:21	cmtptr	I choose tablespoons
2015-05-22 00:04:22	furq	koz_: select(n, ...)
2015-05-22 00:04:44	koz_	Ah, ok.
2015-05-22 00:04:53	koz_	And it'll be 1-indexed as I expect?
2015-05-22 00:04:59	Neffi	select(n, ...) is good for one off things but for many indexes, it's much more efficient to pack it into an array like {...} and index that koz_ 
2015-05-22 00:05:00	furq	yes
2015-05-22 00:05:15	furq	cmtptr: in quake rockets travel at 1000ups, but they're not affected by your velocity
2015-05-22 00:05:28	furq	so if you're going at 1000ups when you fire one it will be going the same speed as you are
2015-05-22 00:05:53	furq	so if you're on a big map you can fire five or six at the wall and then rocketjump off them all at once
2015-05-22 00:06:02	furq	can you do that with your shitty gun
2015-05-22 00:06:22	koz_	Neffi: How would I pack it into an array?
2015-05-22 00:06:29	Neffi	{...}
2015-05-22 00:06:33	furq	{ ... } unless it contains nils
2015-05-22 00:06:38	furq	table.pack if you're on 5.2
2015-05-22 00:06:41	koz_	So just like foo = {...}
2015-05-22 00:06:46	koz_	I'm on 5.3
2015-05-22 00:06:51	Neffi	then table.pack(...)
2015-05-22 00:06:51	furq	that works
2015-05-22 00:06:57	Neffi	if it contains nils
2015-05-22 00:07:04	Neffi	and iterate from 1 to tbl.n
2015-05-22 00:07:24	cmtptr	you can actually use {...} even if it contains nils
2015-05-22 00:07:31	cmtptr	and get the count from select
2015-05-22 00:07:42	Neffi	%5.3  function print_contents(...) local temp = table.pack(...); for i = 1, temp.n do print(temp[i]) end; end; print_contents({'a', 'b', 'c'})  -- example
2015-05-22 00:07:43	yalb	Neffi: table: 0xf3b040
2015-05-22 00:07:44	cmtptr	also, < Neffi> select(n, ...) is good for one off things but for many indexes, it's much more efficient to pack it into an array like {...} and index that koz_
2015-05-22 00:07:47	cmtptr	is that true?
2015-05-22 00:07:49	cmtptr	why?
2015-05-22 00:07:54	furq	more efficient in terms of keystrokes
2015-05-22 00:08:02	Neffi	%5.3  function print_contents(...) local temp = table.pack(...); for i = 1, temp.n do print(temp[i]) end; end; print_contents('a', 'b', 'c')  -- example

2015-05-22 00:08:24	Neffi	cmtptr: select() is not efficient 
2015-05-22 00:08:56	Neffi	you're copying values to and from the stack a shitload when you do a large-ish loop with select(). putting them in a table is really just a plain C array, which is small. 
2015-05-22 00:09:16	cmtptr	there's a varg instruction
2015-05-22 00:09:31	cmtptr	I assumed there was magic that made it efficient
2015-05-22 00:09:51	darkstalker	varg vikernes
2015-05-22 00:10:09	Neffi	I don't remember the details. I remember reading through the sources, deeming select() pretty ugly, and then testing it and see that iterating over an array way more efficient for even relatively small lists of values

2015-05-22 00:38:22	cmtptr	it does a binary search
2015-05-22 00:39:30	cmtptr	the only thing you can be sure of is that t[#t+1] will be nil
2015-05-22 00:39:44	koz_	So if I gave it {[1] = 1, [2] = 2, [3] = nil, [4] = 4}, what would it report?

2015-05-22 00:40:02	koz_	Neffi: I see.
2015-05-22 00:40:05	cmtptr	it could report either 2 or 4
2015-05-22 00:40:06	Neffi	See the manual

2015-05-22 00:40:41	cmtptr	that's why when dealing with arargs you have to use either select or table.pack
2015-05-22 00:40:49	cmtptr	they both handle nil arguments properly
2015-05-22 00:41:00	cmtptr	*varargs
2015-05-22 00:41:27	Neffi	or in 5.1 emulate table.pack with:   { n = select('#', ...), ... }
2015-05-22 00:42:01	koz_	How does table.pack deal with nils?
2015-05-22 00:42:26	cmtptr	it's implimented in c, so it can see the stack size
2015-05-22 00:42:36	cmtptr	and it sets an n field in the table
2015-05-22 00:43:02	koz_	Ah, cool. So if my call was foo(1, 2, nil, 4), what would the n field be set to?
2015-05-22 00:43:11	cmtptr	4
2015-05-22 00:43:15	koz_	OK, cool, thanks.
2015-05-22 00:43:54	Neffi	koz_: table.pack does exactly what I just did
2015-05-22 00:44:09	cmtptr	yeah
2015-05-22 00:44:10	Neffi	it sets 'n' to the size of the input so that you can safely iterate

2015-05-22 12:26:57	cmtptr	technomancy, your module should return a table
2015-05-22 12:27:27	cmtptr	then, other code loads it with "local technomancys_module = require('technomancys_module')"
2015-05-22 12:27:55	cmtptr	furq, if you're going to write it that way then you should 1. name M the name of the module, and 2. use function util.basename(path) ...

2015-05-22 12:28:20	furq	cmtptr: why not call it M
2015-05-22 12:28:34	cmtptr	because that's ugly and a capital letter and why call it M when your module has a name?
2015-05-22 12:28:43	furq	because it's fewer keystrokes and it makes no difference
2015-05-22 12:28:48	cmtptr	technomancy, it doesn't, and neither does putting it in the globals table
2015-05-22 12:28:50	technomancy	like if I make a change in file2 but file2 just returns a table, I can't just reload file2, I have to reload the file that requires file2, except require doesn't actually reload?

2015-05-22 12:55:47	ttmrichter	That's way more than I was expecting, to be honest.
2015-05-22 12:56:01	ttmrichter	I figure 64 bits.  128 on the outside.
2015-05-22 12:56:05	ttmrichter	256?  Wow.
2015-05-22 12:56:12	rjek	52! is a big number.
2015-05-22 12:56:27	ttmrichter	Yeah.  I just didn't grok how big until I did the math.
2015-05-22 12:56:45	rjek	This is why gambling websites tend to use hardware true RNGs
2015-05-22 12:56:50	ttmrichter	With just the 52 you'd need 226 bits.
2015-05-22 12:57:00	ttmrichter	With jokers, that goes to 238.

2015-05-22 20:28:32	leite	do it at first line of your lib/module
2015-05-22 20:28:35	mniip	it is a common idiom to write 'local pairs = pairs' and other stuff in the top of your file
2015-05-22 20:28:35	furq	if you localise globals at the top of your file then you will get an almost inconsequential speedup
2015-05-22 20:28:52	furq	it's only noticeable if you're doing global lookups in a tight loop
2015-05-22 20:29:03	mniip	because then functions using 'pairs' will be using the module locals (upvalues) instead
2015-05-22 20:29:21	mniip	which are accessed by index from the stack instead of by name from the globals table
2015-05-22 20:29:31	furq	globals are in a table, so whenever you look one up it has to do a table lookup (binary search)
2015-05-22 20:29:40	mniip	furq, binary?
2015-05-22 20:29:51	mniip	name lookup is hashed but iterative, I though

2015-05-22 20:31:28	darkstalker	hash tables aren't binary search afaik

2015-05-23 00:20:53	TheBetterBobby	like what code does it use. what api does it reference. or is it just graphics and does not need system level api

2015-05-23 00:21:22	Alissa	^

2015-05-23 00:27:24	furq	there are two reasons why people don't use it

2015-05-23 00:27:47	Alissa	Anyways, speaking of window managers, is there one that uses a "solarized"-like theme?

2015-05-23 17:25:05	_abc_	Hello. I have a lua problem. I am trying to make a lua script define/redefine functions when it is in embedded/non embedded environment, by detecting specific tables and members thereof.

2015-05-23 17:27:17	_abc_	The idea is, the whole if() part is not to run on the environment where tn is not defined.

2015-05-23 17:38:30	Negative_Se7en	im new to Lua.why we should declare a varible as 'local' in the global scope? or what's the difference between 'a' and 'b' in the code snippet ? http://codepad.org/YFKj3t1F
2015-05-23 17:38:51	Neffi	"global scope"? 
2015-05-23 17:38:55	Neffi	you mean at the main chunk level? 
2015-05-23 17:39:09	Neffi	the difference in that file is that a is global and b is local
2015-05-23 17:39:31	Neffi	it's bad to pollute the global environment. globals are access more slowly, and you may get collisions with other modules setting the same global. 
2015-05-23 17:39:40	_abc_	I found the typo ;)
2015-05-23 17:40:23	Neffi	you should make everything local by default Negative_Se7en because it's the safer, saner, and faster approach. if you need to export things the recommended way is to pack them into a table and return that table from the file, and then other modules can require() your file to get that table. 
2015-05-23 17:41:13	Neffi	also your first line should be "#!/usr/bin/env lua"  ;) 
2015-05-23 17:43:42	Negative_Se7en	Neffi, so every file is a kind of a function or something like that ?
2015-05-23 17:43:59	Neffi	the main chunk is a vararg function, yes ;) 
2015-05-23 17:44:17	Neffi	anything you return from the body of the file will be returned from require() when somebody requires() that file
2015-05-23 17:44:41	Neffi	this is how modules work. just return a table, and that table is the module namespace.

2015-05-25 18:19:14	 *	leite wow, need to take a bath
2015-05-25 18:19:17	furq	testing and unstable are both rolling releases
2015-05-25 18:19:25	q66	testing is half-rolling
2015-05-25 18:19:28	furq	testing just takes longer to get new packages
2015-05-25 18:19:38	q66	rolling means it gets in as soon as it gets packaged
2015-05-25 18:19:39	cmtptr	so isn't that effective sid right now?
2015-05-25 18:19:47	q66	sid is the unstable branch
2015-05-25 18:19:49	q66	has always been
2015-05-25 18:19:57	furq	what, because jessie just came out?
2015-05-25 18:19:59	furq	not really
2015-05-25 18:20:06	q66	the new testing was already branched
2015-05-25 18:20:14	cmtptr	so testing is some weird limbo between releases?
2015-05-25 18:20:20	q66	testing == stretch now

2015-05-25 18:20:55	furq	sid is always sid
2015-05-25 18:20:56	q66	basically packages from unstable go into testing after some time without major problems, that goes on for a while, then testing freezes, only fixes are done

2015-05-25 18:21:35	furq	jessie is stable, stretch is testing, sid is unstable

2015-05-25 18:22:11	q66	wheezy was also testing once
2015-05-25 18:22:21	q66	every stable was once testing
2015-05-25 18:22:24	cmtptr	so what is this "sid is sid" stuff
2015-05-25 18:22:30	furq	sid is always sid
2015-05-25 18:22:34	q66	cmtptr, it's the rolling unstable branch, i.e. it always keeps going on
2015-05-25 18:22:35	furq	sid is always unstable
2015-05-25 18:22:42	q66	it's what testing is initially branched from
2015-05-25 18:22:46	cmtptr	so jessie was never unstable?
2015-05-25 18:22:49	q66	it's where packages for testing comes from
2015-05-25 18:22:51	furq	no
2015-05-25 18:22:51	q66	*come
2015-05-25 18:23:03	q66	sid is the initial source of everything
2015-05-25 18:23:14	q66	except security updates
2015-05-25 18:23:15	cmtptr	is this not confusing to anybody else?
2015-05-25 18:23:17	furq	unstable is called sid because sid is the kid next door who blows up toys with fireworks
2015-05-25 18:23:18	q66	no
2015-05-25 18:23:23	furq	and no it's not confusing at all
2015-05-25 18:23:46	q66	you have 3 branches, stable, testing, unstable, unstable is always unstable, testing is what will be new stable, stable is current stable
2015-05-25 18:23:46	furq	i could understand your confusion if we hadn't had this exact conversation about two months ago
2015-05-25 18:23:55	q66	once in a while feature freeze happens, i.e. transition from testing to stable
2015-05-25 18:24:04	q66	then it becomes stable, and new testing is made
2015-05-25 18:24:07	q66	nothing confusing about it
2015-05-25 18:24:28	furq	if it makes you feel better just install and upgrade straight to sid
2015-05-25 18:24:34	furq	then you never need to worry about how any of this works
2015-05-25 18:24:43	q66	by using sid you get a rolling distro with no releases
2015-05-25 18:24:44	cmtptr	q66, you keep explaining stable, testing, and unstable
2015-05-25 18:24:48	cmtptr	that's the part I get
2015-05-25 18:24:55	q66	cmtptr, sid, jessie etc. are just codenames
2015-05-25 18:25:00	furq	the names change because those are the release names
2015-05-25 18:25:06	furq	7 is wheezy, 8 is jessie, etc
2015-05-25 18:25:07	cmtptr	it's the wheezy, jessie, and sid part that I'm confused about
2015-05-25 18:25:15	q66	cmtptr, they're characters from toy story
2015-05-25 18:25:21	cmtptr	I know that
2015-05-25 18:25:31	q66	every release of debian has a codename based on a character from toy story
2015-05-25 18:25:36	cmtptr	I know.
2015-05-25 18:25:37	furq	stretch is debian 9
2015-05-25 18:25:40	furq	debian 9 isn't out yet
2015-05-25 18:25:47	cmtptr	ok
2015-05-25 18:25:53	q66	jessie is debian 8, wheezy is debian 7, lenny is debian 6, etch is debian 5
2015-05-25 18:25:58	furq	when it gets released then stretch will become the stable branch and a new testing branch will be created
2015-05-25 18:26:07	lenny	i have been pinged
2015-05-25 18:26:08	xyzzy_	who is debian named after
2015-05-25 18:26:08	lenny	hello
2015-05-25 18:26:09	q66	every release with a codename is testing first and then becomes stable
2015-05-25 18:26:10	q66	lol
2015-05-25 18:26:20	furq	xyzzy_: ian debian
2015-05-25 18:26:34	q66	i.e. if your system repos are set to "testing", you always track testing.... if your system repos are set to a specific codename, it means you're first running testing, and through updates, your system becomes stable

2015-05-25 23:34:48	ttmrichter	I picked a random name from a phone book and started sending one thing per day.
2015-05-25 23:34:54	ttmrichter	For a month.
2015-05-25 23:34:55	furq	and then his facebook update where he postulated that the band might have broken up because he sent each member of the band an unequal number of parcels and that the ones to whom he sent fewer parcels must have got jealous of the ones who got more
2015-05-25 23:34:56	ttmrichter	Then stopped.
2015-05-25 23:35:15	furq	obviously that was it, not because they all went into witness protection
2015-05-25 23:35:55	furq	also he deleted all his social media profiles so now i'm never going to know if he got his book published
2015-05-25 23:37:02	furq	i only have the 116KB of notes for the film adaptations of the first two novels which he posted to the imdb comments section for wong jing

2015-05-26 00:12:01	LastTalon	I like ubuntu. :P
2015-05-26 00:12:16	furq	ubuntu is just debian for idiots
2015-05-26 00:12:26	LastTalon	:P
2015-05-26 00:12:29	furq	hi
2015-05-26 00:12:29	cmtptr	this is how it works for me to try new things
2015-05-26 00:12:51	furq	you try it and then immediately find as many reasons as possible to hate it?
2015-05-26 00:12:55	cmtptr	I try it first and have a knee-jerk reaction where I throw up all over the room
2015-05-26 00:13:00	furq	i find it's easier to do that before trying it
2015-05-26 00:13:00	cmtptr	then I let a few months go by
2015-05-26 00:13:02	furq	then i don't have to try it
2015-05-26 00:13:10	cmtptr	and then try it again and find it a little more tolerable the second time
2015-05-26 00:13:49	furq	do you have some actual problem with arch or are you just curious
2015-05-26 00:14:03	LastTalon	Is there a problem with using ubuntu? :P
2015-05-26 00:14:03	furq	and i promise i won't make this into some kind of lazy gay joke
2015-05-26 00:14:05	cmtptr	I want to see if debian is easier to maintain and configure
2015-05-26 00:14:39	cmtptr	I'm tired of having to read wikis in order to make my software packages do what I want them to do
2015-05-26 00:14:47	furq	well it's easy enough for me to maintain and configure
2015-05-26 00:14:50	furq	take from that what you will

2015-05-26 00:15:18	cmtptr	I like arch, I'm just now recognizing that it's more of a time sink than I really want out of my every day OS
2015-05-26 00:15:28	cmtptr	but maybe all distros are like that, I don't know
2015-05-26 00:15:47	Alissa	furq: no apt autoremove ?
2015-05-26 00:15:49	furq	i can only really compare it to freebsd
2015-05-26 00:16:45	furq	but one thing i hated about freebsd was the lack of default configs for ports
2015-05-26 00:17:07	furq	idk if it's a debian thing but debian is very good about putting a sensible, commented (often to excess) default config in the right place
2015-05-26 00:17:23	furq	instead of either expecting you to copy a shit config from /usr/local/etc/skel or just not providing one at all
2015-05-26 00:17:52	furq	or from /usr/local/share/whoknows/itisamystery/hellplace/

2015-05-26 00:19:56	Neffi	you mean copying it from ../doc? 
2015-05-26 00:20:03	Neffi	that seems like a totally sensible approach to me
2015-05-26 00:20:19	furq	are you talking about actual ports
2015-05-26 00:20:22	Neffi	don't muck up directories with default files. let the local administrator make those executive decisions. 
2015-05-26 00:20:24	furq	because i obviously meant pkgng
2015-05-26 00:21:06	furq	and if by "default files" you mean "config files that are required for anything to happen" then i don't call that mucking up
2015-05-26 00:21:27	furq	especially compared to not providing a config file at all which is what most ports have done in my experience
2015-05-26 00:21:42	 *	Neffi shrugs
2015-05-26 00:22:00	Neffi	read the docs
2015-05-26 00:22:21	furq	good advice
2015-05-26 00:22:27	Neffi	thx bro
2015-05-26 00:22:31	Neffi	so glad i can be of help
2015-05-26 00:22:33	furq	i'll just piss away an hour to end up coming up with 98% identical config parameters as debian provides
2015-05-26 00:22:50	Neffi	ok then, problem solved
2015-05-26 00:22:54	furq	wouldn't want to muck up my /etc with config files i specifically asked to be installed
2015-05-26 00:23:09	Neffi	certainly not
2015-05-26 00:23:14	furq	and which will be removed when i purge the package, unlike ones i have to create myself
2015-05-26 00:27:36	cmtptr	I don't understand the difference between update and upgrade
2015-05-26 00:27:52	furq	update just pulls the new package list
2015-05-26 00:27:59	furq	it doesn't upgrade any packages
2015-05-26 00:28:07	cmtptr	oh, so git fetch vs git rebase

2015-05-26 00:34:42	cmtptr	then why would I ever use update?
2015-05-26 00:36:41	ttmrichter	So when you install new packages you get the latest ones that actually exist instead of references to old versions that aren't in the repo any longer.
2015-05-26 00:37:24	cmtptr	does debian support installing new packages on a system that needs apt-get upgrade?
2015-05-26 00:37:34	ttmrichter	If you don't have a clash, sure.
2015-05-26 00:37:49	ttmrichter	If you have a clash, you'll have to at the very least upgrade the clashing packages.

2015-05-26 01:29:28	koz_	Very similar to that one.
2015-05-26 01:30:27	Alissa	koz_: The use of OO allows for a better memory management.
2015-05-26 01:30:33	Alissa	THere's no reason to not use OO
2015-05-26 01:30:35	daurnimator	Alissa: wut?
2015-05-26 01:30:53	Alissa	daurnimator: "koz_ │ Goddamn people and their need for OO everywhichwhere."
2015-05-26 01:30:59	Alissa	In reference to the colon syntax.
2015-05-26 01:31:04	daurnimator	OO allows for objects to have methods without the functions being in global scope
2015-05-26 01:31:16	koz_	I don't care for objects having methods.
2015-05-26 01:31:20	daurnimator	passing an object to operate over is common to nearly *every* function
2015-05-26 01:31:35	koz_	I would rather have functions that work on data.
2015-05-26 01:31:43	koz_	But that's a matter of taste.
2015-05-26 01:31:47	Alissa	koz_: Then you can go ahead and use heap.insert or whatever instead of H:insert
2015-05-26 01:31:48	daurnimator	koz_: so you rather C style where you have f = fopen(), fread(f), fclose(f);?
2015-05-26 01:32:32	koz_	darkstalker: Yes.
2015-05-26 01:32:54	koz_	I prefer that, and I for one was glad that Lua doesn't force OO principles down my throat like seemingly every other damn language out there.
2015-05-26 01:33:07	daurnimator	koz_: lots of global functions doesn't seem a great idea
2015-05-26 01:33:18	koz_	I can just use modules, right?
2015-05-26 01:33:30	koz_	Like, make a table, add functions to said table, export said table.
2015-05-26 01:33:48	daurnimator	true. I guess like the string module; which has both the 'string' global; and the same table as __indecx
2015-05-26 01:34:05	Alissa	IO library.
2015-05-26 01:34:19	daurnimator	Alissa: the IO library in lua doesn't have that
2015-05-26 01:34:53	Alissa	I swear I typed a lot more text than just "IO library."
2015-05-26 01:35:21	daurnimator	koz_: it's often nice to have 'duck typing'. e.g. as long as an object implements the method ':read()', it's acceptable for another function
2015-05-26 01:35:31	Alissa	Anyways, as I was saying, FILE* objects are actually metadata so any file accessing you want to do would have to be done with what I think is a __index to the IO library.
2015-05-26 01:35:35	Alissa	is what I actually wrote.
2015-05-26 01:35:40	koz_	daurnimator: Perhaps. My main gripe isn't against *all* OO ever.
2015-05-26 01:35:44	koz_	I just don't wanna be forced to use it.
2015-05-26 01:35:48	technomancy	you can have interfaces without having classes
2015-05-26 01:36:03	technomancy	OO is a bunch of random concepts mashed together; some are good and some are not
2015-05-26 01:36:59	koz_	OO also has an unbelievable number of retarded fanboys and snake oil salesmen.
2015-05-26 01:37:00	daurnimator	technomancy: a class is just two objects with the same interface that happen to use the same functions for those methods
2015-05-26 01:37:13	koz_	Who claim it's like the *best* *thing* *ever* and $DEITY's gift to programming.
2015-05-26 01:38:01	technomancy	daurnimator: sure, when it's done right =)
2015-05-26 01:38:03	technomancy	which is rare

2015-05-26 01:40:45	koz_	technomancy: Right name?
2015-05-26 01:41:00	koz_	Also, is there a Lua function that appends something to a table being used as an array?

2015-05-26 01:41:29	Alissa	koz_: table.insert()
2015-05-26 01:41:56	Alissa	% t = { 3, 2 } table.insert( t, "pineapple" ) print( table.unpack( t ) )
2015-05-26 01:41:56	yalb	Alissa: 3 2 pineapple
2015-05-26 01:41:57	technomancy	If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will deteriorate; if justice goes astray, the people will stand about in helpless confusion. Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.
2015-05-26 01:42:00	koz_	Alissa: Thanks.
2015-05-26 01:42:07	darkstalker	<koz_> darkstalker: Yes.

2015-05-26 01:43:40	technomancy	it's an #emacs thing mostly

2015-05-26 01:45:28	koz_	Those are very nice. I'm gonna need to borrow those sometimes.
2015-05-26 01:45:35	koz_	When I have students bitch about terminology again.
2015-05-26 01:45:58	technomancy	yeah, it's a handy concept
2015-05-26 01:46:14	koz_	Amusingly, many of my students are Chinese. I should learn that in Mandarin.

2015-05-26 11:26:25	furq	it's even shitter than you're imagining
2015-05-26 11:26:30	furq	q66: isn't that called happy hardcore
2015-05-26 11:26:47	q66	no, that's something else i think
2015-05-26 11:26:57	profan	its that with more weeaboo attached
2015-05-26 11:27:02	furq	i'm sure nightcore producers get really defensive if you call it happy hardcore
2015-05-26 11:27:02	q66	furq, also give it an anime protagonist, that's the important part too

2015-05-26 11:27:47	furq	ofc not
2015-05-26 11:27:53	q66	they just take the song, literally speed it up and raise pitch and nothing else
2015-05-26 11:28:04	q66	and give it some weeaboo video

2015-05-26 11:29:28	furq	i'm glad that they've now switched to speeding up trance songs from 2001 instead of using korn
2015-05-26 11:31:20	furq	oh ffs
2015-05-26 11:31:30	furq	thinking about this has also reminded me that they kept putting on some pirate-themed metal band
2015-05-26 11:31:52	furq	which was like listening to domestos being poured through your brain
2015-05-26 11:32:23	furq	they were called MEADFEST or DECKSWABBERZ or some fucking thing

2015-05-26 12:27:19	technomancy	I guess I'd be happy if I could just check whether stdin has any data buffered and yield if reading would block but I can't figure out how

2015-05-28 12:44:53	ntz	yes I am
2015-05-28 12:44:58	profan	he was using Parser::MGC for perl, so i think he is already
2015-05-28 12:45:03	ntz	I'm already attempting to use m//gc
2015-05-28 12:45:04	bone	ah okay.

2015-05-28 13:03:44	SpaceMonkey	rjek, I have a small task I am willing to let someone else have a go as a I know an XML junkie will do it in an hour, and itwill take me a lonnnnng time
2015-05-28 13:03:50	rjek	heh
2015-05-28 13:04:54	SpaceMonkey	basically extract some data from an xml file either into a lua table or intemedary format (say CSV!) and then read the data back in and update the XML with the changed values.
2015-05-28 13:05:15	profan	q66: yeah, writing it by hand is usually much less of a buttpain
2015-05-28 13:05:33	profan	usually prefer the same thing
2015-05-28 13:06:00	q66	it's funny how people claim that using a generator saves time/code/effort, whenever i see any parser written using parser generators it's butt ugly and much less maintainable than a clean hand-rolled parser

2015-05-28 13:06:23	rjek	NetSurf used to use re2c and lemon for its CSS parser
2015-05-28 13:06:27	rjek	It was a slow mess.
2015-05-28 13:06:44	q66	there's a reason for example clang uses a handwritten parser
2015-05-28 13:06:45	rjek	Now it's hand written (although some things are generated using a metalanguage because they're repetitive) it's way faster
2015-05-28 13:06:49	q66	because nothing can beat it

2015-05-28 13:07:31	q66	what about it
2015-05-28 13:07:35	rjek	Their front-end is entirely hand-written.
2015-05-28 13:07:41	q66	yeah, and?
2015-05-28 13:07:44	q66	most fontends are
2015-05-28 13:07:46	q66	*frontends
2015-05-28 13:07:47	rjek	Front end used by Intel's and ARM's compilers, and by Visual Studio for analysis
2015-05-28 13:07:53	q66	yeah, i know
2015-05-28 13:07:54	q66	it's a mess
2015-05-28 13:07:59	q66	but clang's parsing is fine
2015-05-28 13:08:01	q66	and gcc's is also fine
2015-05-28 13:08:06	rjek	I was suggesting that it is probably a contender for beating clang's :)
2015-05-28 13:08:10	profan	rjek: didn't know that, informative
2015-05-28 13:08:15	q66	rjek, no
2015-05-28 13:08:23	q66	visual studio is terrible frontend-wise
2015-05-28 13:08:30	rjek	Not compiler frontend
2015-05-28 13:08:43	rjek	Visual Studio uses EDG for collecting data for autocomplete and syntax highlighting etc
2015-05-28 13:08:48	rjek	The compiler is Microsoft's own frontend
2015-05-28 13:08:48	q66	ah, ok
2015-05-28 13:08:51	q66	no it's not
2015-05-28 13:08:54	q66	they use someone else's :P
2015-05-28 13:08:55	q66	for the compiler
2015-05-28 13:08:58	q66	i thought that was edg
2015-05-28 13:09:00	rjek	Oh, they used to use their own
2015-05-28 13:09:23	rjek	Anyway, the parsers for the two uses are different, and it's only Intellisense that's EDG.
2015-05-28 13:09:33	q66	ok
2015-05-28 13:09:41	q66	so they use 2 different parsers from third parties
2015-05-28 13:10:11	rjek	(Intel's and ARM's compilers warning outputs are almost identical...)
2015-05-28 13:11:44	q66	rjek, basically AFAIK that they use a third party frontend in visual studio is that c++11/14 progress is so slow

2015-05-31 00:13:36	Soni	why did table.maxn get removed again?

2015-05-31 00:15:32	Alissa	For the same reason log10 was removed.

2015-05-31 00:16:40	Soni	no
2015-05-31 00:16:57	Soni	log10 was replaced with log's 2nd parameter/argument
2015-05-31 00:17:42	Soni	math.log(something, 10) is supposed to be equivalent to math.log10(something)

2015-05-31 01:01:40	Soni	cmtptr, GCC is a C compiler

2015-05-31 01:59:07	Pfhoenix	anybody around that can help me really quick?
2015-05-31 01:59:27	Pfhoenix	I'm new to Lua, but not programming, and I'm seeing behavior I don't understand
2015-05-31 01:59:39	Pfhoenix	http://pastebin.com/TqrbJc5u
2015-05-31 02:00:08	Pfhoenix	the world.logInfo should be touched only once
2015-05-31 02:00:56	Pfhoenix	but it's being hit repeatedly, which means my modifying nanite.tiles isn't staying once the code goes out of scope
2015-05-31 02:01:41	furq	table.getn (also you should use # instead of table.getn) only counts array keys
2015-05-31 02:01:44	furq	you're setting a hash key
2015-05-31 02:02:21	furq	% return #({ 1, 2, 3, a = 1 })
2015-05-31 02:02:21	yalb	furq: 3
2015-05-31 02:02:42	Pfhoenix	nice bot
2015-05-31 02:02:57	Pfhoenix	when I use #, I get the same behavior
2015-05-31 02:03:06	furq	yes that's why i said "also"
2015-05-31 02:03:11	furq	the problem is the other thing i said
2015-05-31 02:04:07	Pfhoenix	I'm trying to use a vector (2 floats) and use the components as indices for spatial indexing
2015-05-31 02:04:49	furq	only contiguous integer keys starting from 1 are counted as array keys

2015-05-31 16:15:27	cmtptr	you just install shit with the package manager and it all just works

2015-05-31 16:16:30	darkstalker	cmtptr: no

2015-05-31 16:19:04	furq	that's a luarocks issue
2015-05-31 16:19:06	cmtptr	do you prefer "return 0;" and "return 1;" or "return EXIT_SUCCESS;" and "return EXIT_FAILURE;"
2015-05-31 16:19:20	darkstalker	not just for lua

2015-05-31 16:20:05	darkstalker	so it will try to install it again

2015-05-31 16:57:15	LeEarl	Mum was the first brand of commercial deodorant. Containing a zinc compound as its active ingredient, it was developed and patented by an inventor in Philadelphia in 1888 whose name has been lost to history.[1] It was named for the term "mum" meaning "to keep silent" as in the popular phrase "Mum's the word" [1] Mum was originally sold as a cream in a jar and applied with the fingertips. The small company was bought by Bristol-Myers in 1931.

2015-05-31 17:41:39	Neffi	Worry about your space complexity, not about how many bytes a single thing is taking

2015-05-31 17:43:52	autrilla	I have 6 globals
2015-05-31 17:44:08	Neffi	turn off the garbage collector, check the usage, add them, check the usage

2015-05-31 17:44:38	autrilla	No, I don't know how to do that and I don't think it'll survive without a gc
2015-05-31 17:44:47	BobbyJones	its only a test
2015-05-31 17:44:57	Neffi	globals are to be avoided anyway. if speed is your concern, accessing them is slower than accessing locals. if cleanliness is a concern, polliting the global env is dirty 
2015-05-31 17:45:05	Neffi	collectgarbage('count')
2015-05-31 17:45:11	autrilla	Speed is not my concern, memory is :p
2015-05-31 17:45:12	Neffi	see the manual about the function

2015-05-31 17:46:22	Neffi	probably not even necessary to turn it off
2015-05-31 17:46:29	Neffi	my mind's not in the right place to reason about this shit right now
2015-05-31 17:46:49	Neffi	this is in KiB I think
2015-05-31 17:48:59	BobbyJones	just use locals
2015-05-31 17:48:59	stanreg	Neffi, thanks.
2015-05-31 17:49:04	BobbyJones	every where
2015-05-31 17:49:09	BobbyJones	no globals
2015-05-31 17:49:15	BobbyJones	lol
2015-05-31 17:49:29	Neffi	I agree with BobbyJones 
2015-05-31 17:49:39	BobbyJones	which should work out if you have one main file and the rest are modules
2015-05-31 17:49:51	Neffi	Only use globals if you need to, like if you're running inside of a host that has removed require() for some reason or some shit
2015-05-31 17:50:08	autrilla	Yeah, we should avoid require
2015-05-31 17:50:26	Neffi	BobbyJones: Split all functionality into discrete units that can be required(). It's not only good for avoiding globals, it's good for keeping your code properly organized 
2015-05-31 17:50:40	autrilla	the garbage collector doesn't collect stuff that was ran with require
2015-05-31 17:50:41	BobbyJones	yup

2015-05-31 17:52:05	autrilla	Anyway, having to pass variables every single time sucks
2015-05-31 17:52:23	Neffi	require() keeps a reference to the returned object so that subsequent requires() don't re-execute the file. This is intentional. This is how modules are done. You can nil out this reference, or you can write the module such that this doesn't matter
2015-05-31 17:52:24	autrilla	That's what DIs are for, and I doubt I can run one on this device. So I use globals
2015-05-31 17:52:43	autrilla	I'm using require 'modulename'
2015-05-31 17:52:44	Neffi	Instead of setting a global, you put all your public stuff in a table and return it, and that's cached 
2015-05-31 17:52:48	autrilla	No idea if it's the same thing
2015-05-31 17:52:59	Neffi	alright, well I gotta go make food
2015-05-31 17:53:22	Neffi	But I can assure you things executed subsequent to require() do get GCed, the authors are just failing to understand how require() works 
2015-05-31 17:53:27	Neffi	and writing their modules incorrectly 
2015-05-31 17:53:43	autrilla	They get GCed by what runtime?
2015-05-31 17:53:50	autrilla	That's heavily runtime dependent
2015-05-31 17:55:49	BobbyJones	can do file return values?
2015-05-31 17:56:18	stanreg	BobbyJones, if the code is a returning function, yes.
2015-05-31 17:56:20	autrilla	yes
2015-05-31 17:56:39	BobbyJones	so globals are still not needed
2015-05-31 17:56:54	BobbyJones	you can use dofile to get your modules
2015-05-31 17:56:56	autrilla	I don't like constantly passing stuff around
2015-05-31 17:57:12	BobbyJones	how big is this script?

2015-05-31 18:04:03	Neffi	<autrilla> That's heavily runtime dependent   <- no it's not. require() is not special. it executes the code. but if the file returns an object, it caches that object. if you want an object to be collected, you don't return it from the file so it does not get cached
2015-05-31 18:04:27	mbalmer	autrilla, you are wrong on several levels.
2015-05-31 18:04:27	Neffi	they're doing things incorrectly. it's not require() that's failing to collect. they're holding a reference to the object that they're not aware of
2015-05-31 18:04:31	autrilla	How do you know it caches that object?
2015-05-31 18:04:39	Neffi	because that's how require works
2015-05-31 18:04:43	darkstalker	there could be an embedded plataform that executes lua bytecode natively
2015-05-31 18:04:48	autrilla	Neffi: as I said, I'm using require 'modulename', not require()
2015-05-31 18:04:57	Neffi	autrilla: that's the same
2015-05-31 18:05:04	Neffi	func "" is shorthand for func("")
2015-05-31 18:05:09	autrilla	Ok, I'm niling it when I'm done
2015-05-31 18:05:12	Neffi	require is a function, not a statement
2015-05-31 18:05:33	Neffi	and that's the difference. with require, you need to nil out the cached module object to have it collect 
2015-05-31 18:05:42	Neffi	see the manual about require
2015-05-31 18:05:50	autrilla	for example, local ap = require 'ap'; ap.start_ap(); ap = nil;

2015-05-31 18:06:32	Neffi	yes, the object is being cached so that calling require() again just returns that, instead of reloading 'ap' 
2015-05-31 18:07:13	Neffi	also trust mbalmer, he definitely knows his shit 
2015-05-31 18:07:27	autrilla	I see nothing about caching on the require manual

2015-05-31 18:10:38	Neffi	yes, that ought to work
2015-05-31 18:10:54	Neffi	unless ap is setting a global. but if your previous example works, then that is not the case

2015-05-31 18:12:57	Neffi	ok yes, just doing package.loaded['ap'] = nil is what you want
2015-05-31 18:13:13	mbalmer	autrilla, only a detail:  you don't need the semicolon (;) at the end of statements in Lua.
2015-05-31 18:13:38	autrilla	mbalmer: I know, but it's useful for "minifying"
2015-05-31 18:13:48	Neffi	why are you creating cfg and then nilling it out? 
2015-05-31 18:14:03	mbalmer	that would be my next question as well.
2015-05-31 18:14:09	autrilla	Because I don't need it anymore
2015-05-31 18:14:12	Neffi	wifi.ap.config({ ssid = ..., pwd = ..., etc })
2015-05-31 18:14:19	Neffi	no need to create it to begin with
2015-05-31 18:14:20	autrilla	ah, well
2015-05-31 18:14:32	mbalmer	plus, why not use Lua's table constructor syntax in e.g. ap. lua?
2015-05-31 18:14:35	Neffi	if you're worried about mere bytes of memory, then do this
2015-05-31 18:14:44	Neffi	because table preallocation actually costs you a little bit there ;) 
2015-05-31 18:14:49	Neffi	(On _G) 
2015-05-31 18:15:00	mbalmer	cfg = { ssid = ...., pwd = 'FAVEGA' }
2015-05-31 18:15:13	Neffi	yes that's quicker as well
2015-05-31 18:15:40	Neffi	you can also do like:  require'http'.start_http_server()
2015-05-31 18:15:46	Neffi	no need to store it 
2015-05-31 18:15:48	autrilla	so wifi.ap.config({ssid = DEVICE_TYPE.."-"..SERIAL_NUMBER, pwd="(FAVEGA)"}); directly
2015-05-31 18:15:57	Neffi	(you still need to nil out package.loaded['http'])
2015-05-31 18:16:01	mbalmer	and maybe use local cfg, so it gets GCed when ap.start_ap() exits.  No need to nil it.
2015-05-31 18:16:04	autrilla	ap is not the entry point though, _init is
2015-05-31 18:16:25	Neffi	doesnt matter
2015-05-31 18:16:35	Neffi	also these little single allocations shouldall be local
2015-05-31 18:16:38	Neffi	local http = 
2015-05-31 18:16:40	Neffi	local cfg = 
2015-05-31 18:16:41	Neffi	,,,
2015-05-31 18:17:02	mbalmer	local address = nil is basically useless, btw.
2015-05-31 18:17:18	mbalmer	(temp_probe.lua, line 3)
2015-05-31 18:17:18	Neffi	yeah once the locals lifetime ends, it gets GCed
2015-05-31 18:17:50	autrilla	What is, 'local' or the variable?
2015-05-31 18:18:15	mbalmer	thw whole line.
2015-05-31 18:18:18	mbalmer	the...
2015-05-31 18:18:24	Neffi	globals store their value in a big table. locals store their value in a virtual register and are lexically scoped
2015-05-31 18:18:59	stanreg	autrilla, the variables in ap.lua (cfg and http) are currently global, not local. Therefore, when that function fnishes, these two variables remain. Changing them to local would GC them on exit.
2015-05-31 18:19:03	autrilla	Oh ok, it's useless because I declare it anyway
2015-05-31 18:19:29	Neffi	yes what stanreg said
2015-05-31 18:19:29	mbalmer	it's useless because you set it to nil.

2015-05-31 21:47:03	cmtptr	I can build the grammer and then it's like.... okay, now what do I do?
2015-05-31 21:47:06	daurnimator	cmtptr: so perhaps start from how a parser is used
2015-05-31 21:47:27	daurnimator	cmtptr: usually you read() off a stream; and you need to pass it on to a parser
2015-05-31 21:48:10	cmtptr	yeah
2015-05-31 21:48:20	daurnimator	so parsers are usually split up into ones that can handle streams; and ones that can't
2015-05-31 21:48:25	daurnimator	try and avoid the latter
2015-05-31 21:48:52	daurnimator	anyway, so usually you give some data to a parser; and it will return a list of tokens/things it found
2015-05-31 21:50:33	daurnimator	or they will either take a collection of callbacks on intialistion that they'll call as they encounter each 'thing';
2015-05-31 21:50:35	cmtptr	I kind of would just like to read something about parsing theory from the beginning, if nothing else then just to fill the gaps
2015-05-31 21:51:10	cmtptr	yeah, I usually write the callback method and I kind of don't like it
2015-05-31 21:51:51	daurnimator	cmtptr: yeah. callback is easier to write. but worse to use IMO
2015-05-31 21:52:05	daurnimator	it's easy to go from generator style to callback, but not the other way
2015-05-31 21:54:00	daurnimator	so best to write parsers that return a list of 'things'
2015-05-31 21:54:30	furq	what are you parsing
2015-05-31 21:56:00	cmtptr	nothing in particular
2015-05-31 21:56:19	cmtptr	usually data structures, but I'd like to be able to parse languages too
2015-05-31 21:56:24	daurnimator	cmtptr: I had a quick look around for guides but haven't found anything. so I suggest seeing how much of the wikipedia pages you understand for LALR, LL, and LR parsers.

2015-05-31 23:20:50	daurnimator	ah; apparently pango abstracts over harfbuzz, uniscribe and coretext
2015-05-31 23:21:05	furq	it's ok though because there are at least six different mirrors of it on github
2015-05-31 23:21:25	furq	problem solved x6
2015-05-31 23:21:31	ttmrichter	furq: The actual Pango page doesn't have that weird glyph name.
2015-05-31 23:21:50	furq	yeah i thought i'd never seen it before
2015-05-31 23:22:01	furq	but wikipedia insists that's true and has a rationale for it and everything
2015-05-31 23:22:14	ttmrichter	I suspect it's a joke.
2015-05-31 23:22:35	furq	are you saying an open source project has a joke name

2015-05-31 23:22:52	daurnimator	however, harfbuzz works everywhere anywhere
2015-05-31 23:22:59	daurnimator	so pango seems useless?
2015-05-31 23:23:40	furq	New HarfBuzz provides only text shaping functionality and not text layout or rendering, which require other libraries. Pango (which incorporates HarfBuzz) can be used for higher-level text layout, and FreeType or Anti-Grain Geometry for text rendering.

2015-05-31 23:28:48	furq	if that's directed at me then i just want text rendering so i will use freetype

2015-06-02 01:37:14	ttmrichter	I have a crackpot theory that says Americans changed the sound from Zed to Zee because they couldn't learn the alphabet without singing it to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
2015-06-02 01:37:28	ttmrichter	But because the last letter didn't rhyme, they changed the letter's pronunciation.
2015-06-02 01:37:31	anon	hello ttmrichter
2015-06-02 01:38:05	lpghatguy	ttmrichter, what, do brits not sing the alphabet?
2015-06-02 01:38:16	furq	i actually did learn it like that
2015-06-02 01:38:22	furq	28 years old, i was
2015-06-02 01:38:22	ttmrichter	They probably do now because of the American infection.

2015-06-02 01:38:50	ttmrichter	But you'll find that only in English, and only in American-infected English in particular, do people with alphabetic systems use songs to remember 26 symbols.
2015-06-02 01:38:55	Neffi	you're being so edgy you're gonna cut somebody
2015-06-02 01:38:58	furq	the last two lines were "q r s t u v w / x y z"

2015-06-02 01:56:46	anon	By the looks of that GIF I would say that's about 90 seconds maybe 2 minutes to completely open up
2015-06-02 01:56:48	Neffi	ok how about the good ending? 
2015-06-02 01:56:54	anon	that's a relatively LONG time just for a case to open
2015-06-02 01:56:57	furq	or are you just seeing how low you can sink for fun
2015-06-02 01:57:04	furq	i prefer the evil ending
2015-06-02 01:57:15	lpghatguy	ttmrichter, people sing the alphabet learning Arabic I guess
2015-06-02 01:57:18	Neffi	anon: And in exchange it's now too heavy to maneuver around so you have no choice but to wait those 2 min
2015-06-02 01:57:25	Neffi	literally the worst idea I've seen in months

2015-06-02 01:58:16	Neffi	here's an idea, just throwing it out there
2015-06-02 01:58:20	Neffi	send me some of that money
2015-06-02 01:58:26	Neffi	because I'm pretty sure I can put it to better use

2015-06-02 01:58:53	furq	i didn't know they made weed beer
2015-06-02 01:59:00	Neffi	I was thinking whiskey, beer and food, but OK 
2015-06-02 01:59:12	Neffi	whatever floats your boat
2015-06-02 01:59:21	furq	it would be wasteful to float a boat in whiskey
2015-06-02 01:59:25	furq	you should use water
2015-06-02 01:59:31	ttmrichter	In whiskey?
2015-06-02 01:59:33	Neffi	furq is right, I'm sorry guys
2015-06-02 01:59:36	ttmrichter	You savage!
2015-06-02 01:59:44	Neffi	I dunno what I was thinking
2015-06-02 01:59:57	furq	ttmrichter: i assume he means irish whiskey

2015-06-02 02:00:02	furq	otherwise he certainly wouldn't spell it like that
2015-06-02 02:00:06	Neffi	why do you assume that? 
2015-06-02 02:00:17	furq	because if it's scotch then it's spelled whisky
2015-06-02 02:00:20	ttmrichter	Why would you put water in whiskey?
2015-06-02 02:00:30	ttmrichter	I thought it's spelled "scotch".
2015-06-02 02:00:32	furq	as every schoolboy knows
2015-06-02 02:00:43	furq	also by "scotch" i mean whisky, i don't mean "from scotland"
2015-06-02 02:00:57	furq	if you call a scotsman "scotch" he will fucking hump yer maw
2015-06-02 02:01:04	Neffi	ok scotch buddy
2015-06-02 02:01:16	Neffi	Americans call it whiskey. Deal with it. 
2015-06-02 02:01:34	furq	i've long since got over the fact that americans are wrong about everything
2015-06-02 02:01:39	ttmrichter	So do the Irish and most Canadians that aren't talking about Rye.
2015-06-02 02:02:19	Neffi	And don't pretend to be righteous about this. The Scottish are famous for their whisky, not you. They don't even wanna be part of you guys. 
2015-06-02 02:02:32	furq	that's a great sentence
2015-06-02 02:03:37	Neffi	Anyway I was talking about American whiskey
2015-06-02 02:03:39	furq	anyway you're the one who calls me a "brit" all the time, you can't draw a distinction now

2015-06-02 02:05:05	furq	yes and as such the whisky is mine
2015-06-02 02:05:37	furq	also i know americans have trouble with close elections, but 55% of scots did want to remain in britain
2015-06-02 02:06:16	furq	although i admit that's definitely the correct use of the past tense
2015-06-02 02:06:25	ttmrichter	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbH9hdJir0  He actually managed to find decent preserved eggs.  I'm surprised.

2015-06-02 12:36:43	gp5st	hello. I'm new to lua (this is the first time I'm going to use it.) I noticed there are 3 versions (5.1, 5.2, and 5.3).  Should new projects use 5.3, or is it like python where there is a lot of baggage around versions (e.g. platform support/defaults and library support)?
2015-06-02 12:37:57	ttmrichter	Use whichever version is needed in the game you're using Lua in uses.  :)  Or if you're doing your own work completely from scratch, use whichever version has the libraries you want supporting it.  Or if you're doing everything from scratch and don't give a shit about libraries, use 5.3.
2015-06-02 12:38:46	gp5st	I don't know what libraries I'll need, other than networking and crypto
2015-06-02 12:39:28	icelesstea	For what you'll be using Lua?
2015-06-02 12:40:07	gp5st	https://github.com/jimktrains/cardproto
2015-06-02 12:40:08	ttmrichter	gp5st: That's two libraries right there.
2015-06-02 12:40:30	ttmrichter	I'm pretty sure that LuaSockets has not yet been ported to 5.3 (but would be happy to be proved wrong on this).
2015-06-02 12:40:50	gp5st	ttmrichter: yes, but I don't know _which_ two libraries :)
2015-06-02 12:41:04	ttmrichter	Networking and crypto.
2015-06-02 12:41:31	ttmrichter	Out of the box Lua has almost nothing library-wise.
2015-06-02 12:41:40	ttmrichter	Lua is very much a "no batteries included" kind of language.
2015-06-02 12:42:33	gp5st	ttmrichter: I know that. http://lua-users.org/wiki/CryptographyStuff seems to have many options, so I'm working through which has what I need. ditto for sockts
2015-06-02 12:43:17	ttmrichter	I suspect that you won't be finding a lot of 5.3 support at the moment.
2015-06-02 12:43:36	ttmrichter	Which means you're relegated to 5.2 (maybe even 5.1) or to wrapping a C library you like.
2015-06-02 12:43:45	ttmrichter	That latter is, thankfully, pretty simple.

2015-06-04 01:09:53	Neffi	why is there a snowflake pattern? 
2015-06-04 01:10:20	ttmrichter	From the ammonia salts crystallizing.

2015-06-04 01:13:31	ttmrichter	daurnimator: My own answer to that would be "don't use set/longjmp" which isn't exactly helpful except in the long term.

2015-06-04 01:14:34	ttmrichter	The only way around it is to use pcall/cpcall (or whatever those functions are called), I think.

2015-06-04 01:57:43	daurnimator	an alternative solution could be pushing a userdata onto the stack that has a __gc that does cleanup

2015-06-04 01:58:10	ttmrichter	Oh.  Yeah.  That will suck.
2015-06-04 01:58:20	daurnimator	ttmrichter: so to return something from cpcall you need to stash it in the registry and grab it out again.... ew

2015-06-05 14:17:18	cmtptr	if you need a 5.1 solution, use luaL_register with a 0 for the second argument

2015-06-05 14:19:01	cmtptr	because you want to give it a pointer value of 0
2015-06-05 14:19:10	cmtptr	who knows what NULL is #defined as?
2015-06-05 14:19:19	cmtptr	write what you mean.  you mean 0, so write 0
2015-06-05 14:19:28	leite	nice, thanks
2015-06-05 14:20:03	leite	as far as i know luaL_newlib / luaL_register implies in the require internals
2015-06-05 14:20:54	leite	as a good standard for libraries right?
2015-06-05 14:21:24	mniip	cmtptr, doesn't the C standard say that NULL is basically 0 cast into a pointer type
2015-06-05 14:22:04	cmtptr	you don't need to cast 0 to a pointer type
2015-06-05 14:22:18	cmtptr	and the fact that it's often defined with a typecast in it is even more reason to never use it
2015-06-05 14:22:22	bone	it's not like you really need to use one of the lua functions for this...
2015-06-05 14:22:42	bone	it is such a trivial thing to write a loop and to push cfunctions into a table.
2015-06-05 14:22:51	cmtptr	that too

2015-06-06 00:07:56	jshjsh	my code starts with something like local bit = require "bit"
2015-06-06 00:07:57	jshjsh	local tobit, tohex, bnot, band, bor, bxor, lshift, rshift, arshift, rol, ror, bswap=bit.tobit, bit.tohex, bit.bnot, bit.band, bit.bor, bit.bxor, bit.lshift, bit.rshift, bit.arshift, bit.rol, bit.ror, bit.bswap
2015-06-06 00:08:25	Neffi	well afaik Lua 5.2's bit32 and luajit's bit differ semantically in some areas 
2015-06-06 00:08:36	Neffi	so you may have to write some wrapper functions 
2015-06-06 00:08:52	jshjsh	I don't actually use most of them
2015-06-06 00:09:05	Neffi	just be sure to consult both manuals
2015-06-06 00:09:09	jshjsh	probably just the basics
2015-06-06 00:09:45	jshjsh	How to I test for am I in lua 5.2 or later
2015-06-06 00:09:53	jshjsh	and only include the other library if I'm not
2015-06-06 00:10:11	Neffi	test for the existence of 'bit32' and if that fails test for the existence of 'bit'
2015-06-06 00:10:17	Neffi	you can pcall your require

2015-06-06 00:10:46	jshjsh	that's the recommended way?
2015-06-06 00:11:05	Neffi	I don't know that there's an established convention 
2015-06-06 00:11:15	Neffi	This just seems like the practical and obvious way
2015-06-06 00:11:36	jshjsh	it's nicely specific
2015-06-06 00:11:41	furq	if package.loaded.bit32 then require "bit32" end
2015-06-06 00:11:43	Neffi	you could also test for _VERSION == "Lua 5.3" and loadstring() wrapped functions which use bitops 
2015-06-06 00:11:56	Neffi	furq: what if it's not automatically loaded? 
2015-06-06 00:12:10	furq	if you're in the stock interpreter then it will be
2015-06-06 00:12:19	jshjsh	furq, I like that
2015-06-06 00:12:22	Neffi	That's not mandated by the spec. 
2015-06-06 00:13:08	Neffi	A more correct approach would be to pcall(require, 'bit32') and check for failure. that'll work in any compliant implementations. Lua is often modified or embedded in a host 
2015-06-06 00:13:46	furq	"more correct"
2015-06-06 00:14:23	Neffi	Yes. You're depending upon observed behavior of a single implementation under a narrow set of circumstances, which is bad. 
2015-06-06 00:14:40	Neffi	Also you're British 
2015-06-06 00:15:00	furq	if by that you mean "you've read the source code and know it will definitely work" then sure
2015-06-06 00:15:32	Neffi	should I recompile it so that it doesn't work, creating a 100% compliant alternate implementation of Lua? 
2015-06-06 00:15:46	Neffi	s/recompile/modify and recompile
2015-06-06 00:15:48	furq	if you do that and don't expect it to break things then you're an idiot

2015-06-06 00:16:25	furq	where is this code being run
2015-06-06 00:16:29	Neffi	furq: you know there's a bunch of implementations of Lua right? 
2015-06-06 00:16:37	jshjsh	it's a library I'm making public
2015-06-06 00:16:44	jshjsh	but I've only tested it on luajit
2015-06-06 00:16:49	Neffi	Then it should _definitely_ not assume a specific interpreter

2015-06-06 00:17:07	Neffi	because somebody wants to use it on a fully compliant embedded Lua platform that has changed this specifically to stay light and suddenly it's broken

2015-06-06 00:19:45	Neffi	If you're depending on features not in the spec of the language then you're writing against a specific dialect. If you can avoid that without making your code any more complex or less capable, why wouldn't you? 
2015-06-06 00:19:51	Neffi	Anyway I'm off to go shower. Have fun. 
2015-06-06 00:20:11	furq	you should do what i suggested because it will annoy Neffi 
2015-06-06 00:20:30	Neffi	you should do what I suggested because it would really bother furq to think that I might be right 
2015-06-06 00:20:33	jshjsh	eyeyayay
2015-06-06 00:20:36	Neffi	and also that America is better than Britain 
2015-06-06 00:20:56	jshjsh	I grew up in Canada
2015-06-06 00:21:18	Neffi	so who do you like more, your former slavemasters or your really chill next door neighbors? 
2015-06-06 00:21:32	jshjsh	lol I'm an American though
2015-06-06 00:21:40	Neffi	oh, then the answer is obvious 
2015-06-06 00:21:48	Neffi	ok, now I'm really going to go shower
2015-06-06 00:22:13	jshjsh	sigh.. I wanted to spend all day on a feature... Now I have like 30 minutes to start it and leave
2015-06-06 00:22:18	furq	seriously
2015-06-06 00:22:25	jshjsh	That's hardly enough time to think
2015-06-06 00:22:29	furq	think about how much more wanky bullshit Neffi will write if you use my suggestion
2015-06-06 00:22:34	furq	it'll be like niagara falls
2015-06-06 00:22:46	furq	that's in canada and america so i know you'll definitely understand the metaphor
2015-06-06 00:23:07	jshjsh	I need something like pcall() or pcall()
2015-06-06 00:24:02	furq	have you considered pcall
2015-06-06 00:24:24	itkor	America is a continent not a country
2015-06-06 00:24:57	furq	have you noticed how you never see Neffi and itkor in the same room at the same time

2015-06-06 00:25:41	furq	you don't need two pcalls
2015-06-06 00:25:54	furq	if the first one fails then just require the second one, since you'll need to throw an error if that fails anyway
2015-06-06 00:26:10	itkor	of course people stupid enough to think native americans were Indians are stupid enough to teach themselfes to be the Americans
2015-06-06 00:26:12	jshjsh	No, I need to crash and burn if the second one fails
2015-06-06 00:26:17	furq	yeah exactly
2015-06-06 00:26:26	jshjsh	if you don't have a bit library you deserve to be debugging
2015-06-06 00:26:31	furq	require will throw an error if it fails
2015-06-06 00:26:34	furq	hence you needing to use pcall
2015-06-06 00:26:48	furq	if there are only two alternatives then pcall the first one and run the second one plain

2015-06-06 00:27:51	jshjsh	I just noticed it when I was googling
2015-06-06 00:28:01	jshjsh	I mean c library with lua bindings
2015-06-06 00:28:54	jshjsh	but pure lua has slight advantages
2015-06-06 00:29:33	Neffi	jshjsh: Pure Lua is not very useful really. You need something written in another language eventually. 
2015-06-06 00:29:49	furq	there are people for whom that is a constraint
2015-06-06 00:29:50	Neffi	Whether it's your host providing functionality or C libraries providing something useful or whatever
2015-06-06 00:29:57	furq	whether or not they're lying is another matter
2015-06-06 00:30:06	Neffi	But yes there are situations when you can load Lua modules but not C modules 
2015-06-06 00:30:25	jshjsh	the lua version is relatively fast... I started to rewrite it to be faster, but never finished
2015-06-06 00:30:44	jshjsh	both the c version and the lua version unnecessarily do passes over buffers
2015-06-06 00:31:01	jshjsh	If you turned it into producer/consumer
2015-06-06 00:31:04	Neffi	Having a pure Lua version can help out. Most games which use Lua for extensibility do not allow loading arbitrary C modules, but do allow loading arbitrary Lua code 
2015-06-06 00:31:07	jshjsh	then you wouldn't be blowing cachess
2015-06-06 00:31:33	furq	i can't imagine many games which use utf8 wouldn't support it in the scripting
2015-06-06 00:31:39	furq	but then game developers are fucking shit
2015-06-06 00:31:44	jshjsh	but converting code that passed over buffers into coroutines isn't trival
2015-06-06 00:31:46	furq	so that's probably happened at least once
2015-06-06 00:31:47	Neffi	furq: itkor and I are the same person. Notice how heleft and I came back. Now I'm gonna leave. I bet he comes back. 
2015-06-06 00:31:53	furq	Neffi: i know
2015-06-06 00:32:07	jshjsh	The real purpose of this library is
2015-06-06 00:32:18	Neffi	WoW has no UTF8 functions, but the C API accepts UTF8 data inside strings and presents it on the GUI just fine
2015-06-06 00:32:21	jshjsh	1) you can turn unicode into canonical forms
2015-06-06 00:32:24	jshjsh	so you can compare
2015-06-06 00:32:34	jshjsh	2) you can find graphemes
2015-06-06 00:32:35	Neffi	So users need to use their own libraries to manipulate UTF8 strings 
2015-06-06 00:32:44	jshjsh	so you know where images stop and start

2015-06-06 01:16:53	itkor	this way it should only print the first argument: print((...),"only prints first argument")
2015-06-06 01:17:32	itkor	I don't think there is any good reason for that bug to be in the syntax 
2015-06-06 01:18:04	ttmrichter	It doesn't really qualify as a bug.
2015-06-06 01:18:11	ttmrichter	A bug is unintended behaviour.
2015-06-06 01:18:22	ttmrichter	Given that they've clearly documented it, it was intended behaviour.
2015-06-06 01:18:32	ttmrichter	You may disagree with the design, but that doesn't make it a bug.
2015-06-06 01:19:51	itkor	do you know the reason why it is that way?
2015-06-06 01:20:04	ttmrichter	Sadly my telepathy machine has a bug (real bug) in it.

2015-06-06 01:20:46	ttmrichter	That BY DEFINITION makes it not a bug.

2015-06-06 01:22:38	ttmrichter	Note the definition of a parameter list:
2015-06-06 01:22:53	ttmrichter	parlist ::= namelist [',' '...'] | '...'
2015-06-06 01:23:24	ttmrichter	That is how the language is defined.  It's the grammar of the language.  You may consider it an incorrect design, but it is emphatically not a bug.
2015-06-06 01:30:35	itkor	still I would fix that and call it "Lua 5.4 vararg bug fixed"
2015-06-06 01:32:37	ttmrichter	You can be an idiot if you choose, I guess.
2015-06-06 01:33:09	ttmrichter	Here's a thought: fork Lua and fix that "bug" and watch the world run over to your version that fixes such an obvious problem that ... literally nobody I've seen has ever complained about it before.
2015-06-06 01:33:52	technomancy	I didn't realize it was impossible to document bugs
2015-06-06 01:35:48	ttmrichter	You can.  "BUG: This function should return nil on error, but instead formats your hard drive."
2015-06-06 01:35:56	itkor	Lua doesn't have any fast way to pass data instead of arguments, building strings is slow and building tables is even slower 
2015-06-06 01:35:56	ttmrichter	That's what a documented bug looks like.
2015-06-06 01:36:47	ttmrichter	Vs.  foo() - Prints the string passed to it.  Formats your hard drive if the argument is not a string.
2015-06-06 01:37:07	technomancy	you can have design bugs easily enough
2015-06-06 01:37:10	ttmrichter	In the first, it's clearly an oversight that they're aware of and plan to fix because it doesn't match their intent.
2015-06-06 01:37:19	furq	i didn't know hard disk formatting was part of ansi c
2015-06-06 01:37:28	ttmrichter	In the second, it's clearly INTENDED to perform that way (whether or not this is advisable).
2015-06-06 01:37:34	ttmrichter	furq: This is for a rock.
2015-06-06 01:37:52	technomancy	sure, but if your intentions are wrong that's called a design flaw or a design bug
2015-06-06 01:37:59	ttmrichter	A bug is, again, *UNINTENTIONAL* negative functionality.
2015-06-06 01:37:59	technomancy	like how JS treats 0 as equal to "0"
2015-06-06 01:38:06	technomancy	I disagree
2015-06-06 01:38:07	ttmrichter	If it's working as intended, it is not a bug.
2015-06-06 01:38:25	ttmrichter	Want a cookie?
2015-06-06 01:38:30	ttmrichter	You can disagree all you like.
2015-06-06 01:38:32	ttmrichter	You're just wrong.
2015-06-06 01:38:35	technomancy	if it's intended that the language works well, and yet you have an intentional feature that makes it works badly, that's a design bug
2015-06-06 01:38:38	ttmrichter	There's a "bug" in your definition in that it's fucking stupid.
2015-06-06 01:38:39	furq	0 == "0" isn't a bug
2015-06-06 01:38:42	furq	it's just fucking stupid

2015-06-06 13:54:03	Neffi	they're still using stickers for the item name, so they're actually creating _more_ work for the employees that stock the shelves
2015-06-06 13:54:12	Zupoman	from which the HQ can dictate the prices
2015-06-06 13:54:37	cmtptr	maybe the price fluctuates very often like gas
2015-06-06 13:54:41	Neffi	If the store really wanted to dictate their prices, they could shuffle items around
2015-06-06 13:54:45	Neffi	There would be no point
2015-06-06 13:55:05	Zupoman	maybe it's gas
2015-06-06 13:55:07	Neffi	Plus individual stores tend to change prices a lot. They need to move merchandise that has been sitting or isn't as valuable as the shelf space, etc

2015-06-06 14:02:02	furq	that's for one unit from a UK retailer, they're probably much cheaper in bulk from china
2015-06-06 14:02:32	Zupoman	it has two running modes, „single conversion mode” which lets you perform one convertion every time you invoke it, and „free running mode” which automatically performs conversions for you and just throws you an interrupt every time it's done
2015-06-06 14:02:52	itkor	LCD displays are dirty cheap but imagine changing batteries for 30k items in the shop if the battery lasts like 6 months
2015-06-06 14:03:16	Zupoman	the single conversion mode works perfecto good, but the free running mode doesn't give any response at all

2015-06-06 14:41:04	leite	not to confuse with middleware?

2015-06-06 14:41:06	furq	you mean it's a perfectly cromulent word
2015-06-06 14:41:14	Neffi	It obeys the semantics of the language and it describes something for which there is no existing word. That is literally the legal way to define new words. 
2015-06-06 14:41:32	Neffi	you zifweegee
2015-06-06 14:41:53	mniip	Neffi, shut up you gumblesnarp

2015-06-06 14:42:13	Neffi	why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love mniip? 
2015-06-06 14:42:13	furq	there's already a word for Neffi 
2015-06-06 14:42:16	leite	Neffi is middleware wrapper for furq
2015-06-06 14:42:43	frew	ok, well that worked, but now I'm getting regular lua errors

2015-06-06 22:13:51	furq	they're all shit
2015-06-06 22:13:57	furq	so you might as well use wx

2015-06-06 22:15:47	jshjsh	have your work thread yield a lot
2015-06-06 22:15:59	furq	but honestly if you know enough C++ to get by, i'd just write the gui in that and embed lua

2015-06-06 23:30:19	lpghatguy	jshjsh, it's mostly just a visual cue, since that's the convention in some other languages (like Ruby)
2015-06-06 23:30:28	lpghatguy	vector.normalize!() is inplace whereas vector.normalize() is not
2015-06-06 23:30:45	jshjsh	Oooh, it's lispish
2015-06-06 23:31:02	jshjsh	to give you a larger character set
2015-06-06 23:31:08	lpghatguy	pretty much
2015-06-06 23:31:12	jshjsh	It will only cause horrible headaches for people
2015-06-06 23:31:21	jshjsh	who want to use programs not in english
2015-06-06 23:31:34	jshjsh	but eventually I'm going to put in full unicode support in the parser
2015-06-06 23:31:48	jshjsh	lol so variable names can be in japanese or hebrew
2015-06-06 23:31:52	jshjsh	or hangul
2015-06-06 23:31:58	jshjsh	horrible eh?
2015-06-06 23:32:01	lpghatguy	that's pretty terrible
2015-06-06 23:32:05	jshjsh	I know right
2015-06-06 23:32:07	lpghatguy	I use \26 and \27 for string placeholders
2015-06-06 23:32:27	jshjsh	but that's why I made a unicode library that does full normalization
2015-06-06 23:32:36	jshjsh	it can always tell if two strings print the same
2015-06-06 23:32:48	jshjsh	even if they were originally encoded differently
2015-06-06 23:33:02	lpghatguy	that sounds like a lot of work for a superset language
2015-06-06 23:33:12	jshjsh	I'm a perfectionist
2015-06-06 23:33:26	jshjsh	also you want full unicode support for non-language projects
2015-06-06 23:33:37	jshjsh	I mean non-programming language
2015-06-06 23:33:55	lpghatguy	of course
2015-06-06 23:34:07	jshjsh	so you should be able to say to it "break into graphemes" and is this character some sort of letter?
2015-06-06 23:34:07	lpghatguy	You know, one thing I'd like is static type analysis
2015-06-06 23:34:20	 *	jshjsh runs screaming

2015-06-06 23:35:23	jshjsh	yeah sometimes
2015-06-06 23:35:35	lpghatguy	Well, that's why it's opt-in and optional
2015-06-06 23:36:03	jshjsh	you must already have types
2015-06-06 23:36:37	lpghatguy	Yeah, I guess an issue is that it would require locking down of some sort of class system like moonscript does
2015-06-06 23:36:39	jshjsh	if you can figure out that vec3->xyz should be vec3->x,vec3->y,vec3->z
2015-06-06 23:36:50	jshjsh	which scares my hogie
2015-06-06 23:36:57	jshjsh	also what is -> ?
2015-06-06 23:37:05	lpghatguy	it's basically an array lookup by name
2015-06-06 23:37:21	lpghatguy	so ({1, 2, 3})->xyz yields (1, 2, 3)
2015-06-06 23:37:28	lpghatguy	and ({1, 2, 3})->zyx yields (3, 2, 1)
2015-06-06 23:37:29	jshjsh	uhm vec3->x isn't vec3.x
2015-06-06 23:37:35	lpghatguy	correct
2015-06-06 23:37:41	jshjsh	and it's not vec3[x]

2015-06-06 23:38:03	jshjsh	yeah I was thinking of putting that in
2015-06-06 23:38:19	jshjsh	I suspect that luajit doesn't have the concept of a type
2015-06-06 23:38:29	jshjsh	where two objects with the same hash items
2015-06-06 23:38:33	jshjsh	can use the same trace

2015-06-06 23:38:44	jshjsh	it probably only specializes for a specific table
2015-06-06 23:38:46	lpghatguy	I'm not sure how luajit compiles things like that
2015-06-06 23:38:49	jshjsh	which is horrible
2015-06-06 23:39:06	jshjsh	... so if you want .x .y and .z to be aways fast
2015-06-06 23:39:17	jshjsh	then they have to be [1] [2] [3]
2015-06-06 23:39:33	lpghatguy	They're both really fast
2015-06-06 23:40:01	lpghatguy	but yeah, basically ->xyz does a compile-time hash
2015-06-06 23:40:05	jshjsh	is luajit smart enough to say aVec and anotherVec came from the same tablebuilder so they may have the same hash?
2015-06-06 23:40:19	jshjsh	Is it smart enough if they came from different table builders?
2015-06-06 23:40:24	lpghatguy	I don't think it optimizes hash lookups that intenselyt
2015-06-06 23:40:26	jshjsh	I should ask Mike Pall
2015-06-06 23:40:53	jshjsh	I'm still in pain that there's no native table:clone
2015-06-06 23:41:00	lpghatguy	Isn't there in 5.3?
2015-06-06 23:41:08	jshjsh	not in luajit
2015-06-06 23:41:15	jshjsh	I've never even looked at 5.3
2015-06-06 23:41:28	lpghatguy	table.move lets you move things
2015-06-06 23:41:34	lpghatguy	I wish there was an easier way to preallocate tables from the lua side
2015-06-06 23:41:40	jshjsh	in which version?
2015-06-06 23:41:44	lpghatguy	5.3
2015-06-06 23:41:59	lpghatguy	I *almost* added an operator to preallocate a table with array size N and hash size M
2015-06-06 23:42:05	lpghatguy	but it produced such terrible code
2015-06-06 23:42:19	jshjsh	luajit refuses to optimize tables that have both hash and array
2015-06-06 23:42:31	jshjsh	(which are separate pointers by the way)
2015-06-06 23:42:32	lpghatguy	well, you'd probably pick one or the other
2015-06-06 23:43:08	jshjsh	it's a bit painful that people use nil so much in lua yet it means "delete this slot"

2015-06-06 23:44:06	lpghatguy	Maybe it'd be a good idea to have a 'none' type in this language
2015-06-06 23:44:15	jshjsh	they should have separated none and nil

2015-06-06 23:44:49	jshjsh	that's a problem with lua in general
2015-06-06 23:44:52	jshjsh	it's too low level
2015-06-06 23:44:54	lpghatguy	let's just write a new language

2015-06-06 23:45:33	jshjsh	I'm starting with just luajit
2015-06-06 23:45:45	jshjsh	I figure that's already on everything
2015-06-06 23:45:49	lpghatguy	that's what my compiler is written in
2015-06-06 23:45:53	jshjsh	if I just generate lua
2015-06-06 23:46:15	jshjsh	so I'm kind of using luajit as if it were the jvm
2015-06-06 23:46:23	jshjsh	also I LIKE lua syntax
2015-06-06 23:46:42	jshjsh	the big clunky language turns out to be much easier to read than c or c++

2015-06-07 01:00:19	Pfhoenix	ok
2015-06-07 01:00:20	lpghatguy	technomancy, do you have any examples of what you're talking about in regards to pattern matching instead of multiple return?
2015-06-07 01:00:32	jshjsh	it allowed pattern matching on parts of function heads
2015-06-07 01:00:34	leite	%= {} + {}
2015-06-07 01:00:37	furq	yeah i don't get that either
2015-06-07 01:00:37	jshjsh	with guards
2015-06-07 01:00:47	lpghatguy	I don't have a strong lisp background
2015-06-07 01:00:54	furq	i figured pattern matching would be an argument against no arity checks
2015-06-07 01:01:08	technomancy	lpghatguy: it's not really a lisp thing, but sure
2015-06-07 01:01:31	jshjsh	but I don't know of anything that helps with many return values
2015-06-07 01:01:46	technomancy	lpghatguy: basically multiple return values means that every function returns a list of values, but that list isn't reified at all
2015-06-07 01:01:48	lpghatguy	the alternative to multiple return in my mind is a tuple type
2015-06-07 01:01:52	technomancy	it's not a first-class value
2015-06-07 01:01:54	Pfhoenix	doesn't lua do multiple return values?
2015-06-07 01:02:09	jshjsh	I do find a,b,c,d = fn() ... then do tests to see what you got back and how many to be really clean
2015-06-07 01:02:11	Pfhoenix	local i, j = multireturn()
2015-06-07 01:02:28	jshjsh	and it's efficient because stuff isn't being put in lists and then taken apart
2015-06-07 01:02:29	lpghatguy	Pfhoenix, correct
2015-06-07 01:02:29	technomancy	lpghatguy: so the semantics of having actual values and then this murky "magic tuple value" that every function returns feels just sloppy
2015-06-07 01:02:31	jshjsh	it's just a stack
2015-06-07 01:02:56	Pfhoenix	is there ever a good reason to do multiple return over returning a list?
2015-06-07 01:02:57	lpghatguy	technomancy, then why not have functions that would return multiple values instead return a non-magical tuple?
2015-06-07 01:02:59	technomancy	jshjsh: it's pretty easy to optimize the list away with a compiler
2015-06-07 01:03:10	lpghatguy	Like ES6's destructuring let in JS
2015-06-07 01:03:13	jshjsh	but here the compiler is luajit
2015-06-07 01:03:16	lpghatguy	let {a, b} = multireturn();
2015-06-07 01:03:19	jshjsh	I don't get control over what it can to
2015-06-07 01:03:22	jshjsh	*do
2015-06-07 01:03:32	lpghatguy	I'm out again for a little bit, brb
2015-06-07 01:03:42	technomancy	lpghatguy: what I'm saying is that destructuring/pattern matching is a way to get the same benefits without muddying the language's semantics
2015-06-07 01:03:51	Pfhoenix	returning a list means you can get the count without manually checking which variables didn't get set
2015-06-07 01:03:53	lpghatguy	technomancy, is that technically really close to what I'm using?
2015-06-07 01:04:13	lpghatguy	anyways, see you on the far side
2015-06-07 01:04:16	technomancy	lpghatguy: I am not familiar with destructuring in JS, but it seems so
2015-06-07 01:04:46	jshjsh	maybe it could aways be implemented with multiple return values
2015-06-07 01:05:08	technomancy	jshjsh: pattern matching has flow control built-in, so you don't need separate checks against those values (in your a,b,c,d = fn() example)
2015-06-07 01:05:36	technomancy	the compiler can even perform exhaustiveness checks to make sure you aren't missing any cases, which is a very common mistake
2015-06-07 01:06:04	technomancy	plus it doesn't really result in any runtime overhead; the pattern match is all calculated at compile time
2015-06-07 01:06:07	jshjsh	you really are talking about algebraic data types aren't you
2015-06-07 01:06:17	jshjsh	that's pretty far from what lua does well I suspect
2015-06-07 01:06:20	jshjsh	but I'm really tired
2015-06-07 01:06:25	jshjsh	so maybe I'm missing something
2015-06-07 01:06:44	technomancy	the exhaustiveness checks need a little more type smarts, yeah

2015-06-07 01:06:59	technomancy	but you can get them without an ML-like type system; erlang does it with dialyzer
2015-06-07 01:07:00	jshjsh	luajit can also make c data structures
2015-06-07 01:07:13	jshjsh	but if they contain pointers, none of those will be garbage collected
2015-06-07 01:07:19	jshjsh	so it's pretty broken
2015-06-07 01:07:42	furq	they will be if you allocate the pointers with ffi.new
2015-06-07 01:08:08	jshjsh	the r/g/b example would be more efficient that way
2015-06-07 01:08:09	furq	or if you set a __gc on the structure which frees them
2015-06-07 01:08:28	jshjsh	the structures are gced
2015-06-07 01:08:32	jshjsh	but the pointers aren't followed
2015-06-07 01:08:45	furq	i mean call ffi.C.free() in __gc
2015-06-07 01:08:47	jshjsh	you need pointers outside of those to prevent gcing on used stuff
2015-06-07 01:13:08	jshjsh	it's a bit weird my tokenizer came out in pure functional style
2015-06-07 01:13:19	jshjsh	instead of altering a file position and line number and column
2015-06-07 01:13:34	jshjsh	each function takes those in as parameters and returns them right back out
2015-06-07 01:14:23	jshjsh	it IS oddly cleaner to not have side effects...
2015-06-07 01:15:04	jshjsh	I can decide to reject a token by just not using the returned values.

2015-06-07 02:14:55	ttmrichter	It has a static type system that's very similar to the MLs and Haskell.  Including typeclasses even, but no higher-kinded types (so again not as strictly mathematically powerful as Haskell's).
2015-06-07 02:15:07	ttmrichter	But it also has a static mode system.
2015-06-07 02:15:11	ttmrichter	And a static determinism system.
2015-06-07 02:15:25	jshjsh	I only think of Mercury as prolog without cuts
2015-06-07 02:15:32	jshjsh	and more limited variables
2015-06-07 02:15:46	ttmrichter	And strict, statically-checked modes and determinism.
2015-06-07 02:15:50	ttmrichter	And actual functions.
2015-06-07 02:16:00	ttmrichter	And a module system that doesn't come from the flaming bowels of Hell.
2015-06-07 02:16:05	jshjsh	yeah the modes are the limited variables
2015-06-07 02:16:20	ttmrichter	Ah, I thought you meant the inability to alias.
2015-06-07 02:16:36	ttmrichter	It doesn't quite give full Prolog-style unification.
2015-06-07 02:16:48	jshjsh	prolog is so interesting... but missing stuff
2015-06-07 02:16:49	lpghatguy	Language theory is really interesting
2015-06-07 02:16:49	ttmrichter	It gives only about 90% of unification.
2015-06-07 02:16:58	lpghatguy	I've never done anything legitimate in Haskell or Scheme
2015-06-07 02:17:24	jshjsh	i'll include a prolog like dialect
2015-06-07 02:17:29	jshjsh	I did that in scheme once
2015-06-07 02:17:30	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: I can't stand most Lisps, so I've done next to nothing in Scheme.  But I did give Haskell the good old college try.  For about eight years.
2015-06-07 02:17:37	lpghatguy	wow
2015-06-07 02:17:38	jshjsh	but I want a search library
2015-06-07 02:17:46	jshjsh	with a lot more options than depth first
2015-06-07 02:17:52	ttmrichter	jshjsh: Ciao
2015-06-07 02:17:54	lpghatguy	I've used Scheme for precisely one project, and it was a pretty short forray

2015-06-07 02:18:14	jshjsh	well the first thing i'm adding is continuations
2015-06-07 02:18:16	ttmrichter	Ciao has dozens of extensions (where extensions are part of the language definition) that include different searching strategies.
2015-06-07 02:18:35	jshjsh	based on  making a new kind of function that's translated to continuation passing style

2015-06-07 02:18:46	ttmrichter	If I had more time I'd be doing my level best to learn Ciao right now.
2015-06-07 02:18:50	lpghatguy	the ownership system is really awkward for so many cases
2015-06-07 02:19:11	jshjsh	you have to create a prompt, then you can save continuations back to the prompt
2015-06-07 02:19:22	ttmrichter	Rust is one of those things that was interesting to me when first announced, but then they pared back one interesting feature after another until they left this uninteresting husk.
2015-06-07 02:19:25	jshjsh	there will also be a composing prompt
2015-06-07 02:19:33	jshjsh	when you run a continuation

2015-06-07 02:19:39	lpghatguy	Rust has so many things I really like
2015-06-07 02:19:43	jshjsh	it throws it back to a pcall 
2015-06-07 02:19:47	ttmrichter	The recent trend toward political whinging in the Rust community has pretty much put the final nail into the coffin for me.
2015-06-07 02:19:55	jshjsh	and that is the composing prompt
2015-06-07 02:19:55	lpghatguy	the 'match' expression, great numeric types, ownership, threading, boxing all great
2015-06-07 02:20:03	jshjsh	and runs the continuation there
2015-06-07 02:20:19	jshjsh	I wonder if that made sense to anyone but me... probably not
2015-06-07 02:20:44	jshjsh	continuations are pretty obscure and hard to understand
2015-06-07 02:20:50	jshjsh	they're not as bad as monads though
2015-06-07 02:20:53	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Gray_code#Mercury
2015-06-07 02:21:05	ttmrichter	That's a simple, (IMHO) easy to follow Mercury example.
2015-06-07 02:21:48	ttmrichter	lpghatguy:  http://yfl.bahmanm.com/Members/ttmrichter/yfl-blog/two-turing-machines
2015-06-07 02:22:08	ttmrichter	And that's an article that compares implementation of a Turing Machine emulator in Prolog vs. Mercury with some pontification on typing.
2015-06-07 02:22:10	lpghatguy	that's really odd
2015-06-07 02:22:19	lpghatguy	that is, Mercury sure is
2015-06-07 02:22:58	jshjsh	an interesting thing about log languages that lack cut is that you can use different search strategies
2015-06-07 02:23:09	lpghatguy	Prolog has some interesting function arity stuff
2015-06-07 02:23:10	jshjsh	you could do depth first or width first or iterative deepening
2015-06-07 02:23:18	jshjsh	or combinations
2015-06-07 02:23:22	ttmrichter	jshjsh: Ciao
2015-06-07 02:23:35	jshjsh	Caio is just prolog
2015-06-07 02:23:39	ttmrichter	It's a Prolog dialect, it HAS cut, and it also has the ability to use different search and execution strategies.
2015-06-07 02:23:40	jshjsh	afik
2015-06-07 02:23:59	jshjsh	you can't have cut with anything but depth first
2015-06-07 02:24:01	ttmrichter	Ciao is way beyond Prolog.
2015-06-07 02:24:10	lpghatguy	I can't hardly read that Mercury example
2015-06-07 02:24:19	ttmrichter	Read the manual.
2015-06-07 02:24:26	jshjsh	woohoo I'm in a chat with langauge nerds 
2015-06-07 02:24:51	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: OK, first thing, the module is divided into the "interface" section (what the outside sees) and the "implementation" section (what is actually there).
2015-06-07 02:25:02	jshjsh	:3 and better than lambdatheultimate where they're all academics who talk in lambda notations I can't read (yet?)
2015-06-07 02:25:11	jshjsh	and think in proofs
2015-06-07 02:25:12	ttmrichter	If you've had experience with languages that have proper modules (Modula-2, Modula-3, Dylan, Oberon, etc.) this is familiar.
2015-06-07 02:25:16	jshjsh	and only care about types
2015-06-07 02:25:30	ttmrichter	If you haven't, that will already be weird.
2015-06-07 02:25:38	ttmrichter	Think of the "interface" section as the header file.
2015-06-07 02:25:51	ttmrichter	And you can only ever see the header file from outside.
2015-06-07 02:26:06	jshjsh	it's funny that lua's lack of a module system is a pretty good one
2015-06-07 02:26:15	jshjsh	as long as every file returns a table
2015-06-07 02:26:25	jshjsh	and you have to extract everything out of it into locals
2015-06-07 02:26:27	ttmrichter	So I've declared two functions (from_int/1 and to_int/1) and one predicate (coerce).
2015-06-07 02:26:30	jshjsh	that you intend to use
2015-06-07 02:26:34	ttmrichter	Sorry.  coerce/2.
2015-06-07 02:27:06	jshjsh	though I use a prototype/class system I wrote for lua that just defines each class as a global
2015-06-07 02:27:07	lpghatguy	I'm not a fan of lua's module system
2015-06-07 02:27:08	jshjsh	>.>
2015-06-07 02:27:27	lpghatguy	I'm a global namespace kind of person
2015-06-07 02:27:41	jshjsh	so I require a file with class definitions and then just use the classes
2015-06-07 02:28:42	ttmrichter	Ugh.
2015-06-07 02:28:58	lpghatguy	I wrote a big lua module to grab a root object and then map namespaces+classes straight to the filesystem
2015-06-07 02:29:01	ttmrichter	I hate class/instance OOP with a shining hatred that would make the sun seem dim.
2015-06-07 02:32:34	jshjsh	the weirdness with prototypes for classes
2015-06-07 02:32:38	jshjsh	is when you do deep copy
2015-06-07 02:32:48	jshjsh	do you copy the prototype?
2015-06-07 02:33:05	jshjsh	if the prototype is an object, then do you copy it when you make it into a class
2015-06-07 02:33:26	jshjsh	if the prototype object changes, do the default values in existing objects change?
2015-06-07 02:33:34	lpghatguy	These are decisions you get to make!
2015-06-07 02:33:47	jshjsh	what if the prototype has a prototype?
2015-06-07 02:33:56	jshjsh	how deep does deepcopy go?
2015-06-07 02:34:15	technomancy	all this just to make the java refugees happy ._.
2015-06-07 02:34:44	lpghatguy	Hey, I *like* class/instance OOP
2015-06-07 02:35:26	jshjsh	my system is prototype based because that's what's easy in lua
2015-06-07 02:35:38	jshjsh	though my class function does copy the prototype
2015-06-07 02:35:40	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: You also like using global variables, so your taste is highly suspect...  ;)
2015-06-07 02:35:45	lpghatguy	noo, not global variables
2015-06-07 02:36:03	jshjsh	partially because it needs to put methods in it
2015-06-07 02:36:09	 *	lpghatguy tries to find a way to explain graphene modules
2015-06-07 02:36:12	lpghatguy	It's like C#!
2015-06-07 02:36:13	jshjsh	It could just make a proxy object
2015-06-07 02:36:26	jshjsh	but that would make code slower
2015-06-07 02:36:43	jshjsh	ie an object who's __index points at the prototype
2015-06-07 02:36:49	jshjsh	then put methods there
2015-06-07 02:37:02	jshjsh	maybe that's more correct lua?
2015-06-07 02:37:12	jshjsh	lua doesn't seem to encourage copying
2015-06-07 02:37:17	jshjsh	but copying is better practice
2015-06-07 02:37:25	lpghatguy	I've got so many different copy methods
2015-06-07 02:37:45	technomancy	copying methods are good, copy-on-write data structures are better =)
2015-06-07 02:38:38	lpghatguy	All my object methods copy by default but have in-place variants
2015-06-07 02:39:22	jshjsh	technomancy, there's no "become" in lua
2015-06-07 02:39:40	jshjsh	and you can't change a metatable once set

2015-06-07 02:40:11	jshjsh	so it's hard to turn an object to copy-on-write
2015-06-07 02:40:19	lpghatguy	You can change a metatable!
2015-06-07 02:40:28	jshjsh	no you can't set it twice
2015-06-07 02:40:48	lpghatguy	you can!
2015-06-07 02:40:49	jshjsh	and if you alter an existing metatable you'll affect every object that has the same table

2015-06-07 13:34:28	bone	ldoc is similar to luadoc but slightly better.
2015-06-07 13:36:56	jshjsh	Another important characteristic of the Actor model is locality.
2015-06-07 13:36:57	jshjsh	Locality means that in processing a message, an Actor can send messages only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it already had before it received the message, and addresses for Actors that it creates while processing the message. (But see Synthesizing Addresses of Actors.)

I'm trying to get the charset of a webpage, and I want to get whatever between charset= and ". Here is the idea: http://codepad.org/wSR8Ikki   the thing is I would like to know how to make a pattern because I thought doing string:match("charset=.+\"")  I would get what I desire. I understood you can do: string:match("fromYOURCONDITIONto") but it seems not.

2015-06-07 17:47:31	floralshoppe	god this random system in lua is fucked
2015-06-07 17:47:44	floralshoppe	i managed to get it to work in a way
2015-06-07 17:47:45	furq	floralshoppe: it's just rand(3)
2015-06-07 17:48:15	furq	you need to seed randomseed with a random number obtained from a proper source of randomness
2015-06-07 17:48:24	furq	os.time() will do in a pinch but ideally you'd read from /dev/urandom or something
2015-06-07 17:48:36	floralshoppe	i did os.time but it still isnt quite random
2015-06-07 17:48:48	FabioGNR	random is a weird term
2015-06-07 17:48:57	lpghatguy	rand(3) isn't very good
2015-06-07 17:48:58	FabioGNR	1000 times the same number, could still be random
2015-06-07 17:49:02	furq	if you're on linux then just read from /dev/urandom
2015-06-07 17:49:05	lpghatguy	you might want to implement your own rand algorithm
2015-06-07 17:49:08	furq	and yeah rand(3) sucks
2015-06-07 17:49:26	furq	hopefully more distros follow openbsd's lead
2015-06-07 17:49:40	lpghatguy	Is OpenBSD's rand(3) not garbage?
2015-06-07 17:50:04	furq	idk if they've done it yet but they were planning on making rand call arc4random
2015-06-07 17:50:22	furq	they audited the base tree and found that something like 4% of packages depended on having deterministic behaviour

2015-06-07 21:01:25	jshjsh	playing with getfenv is a bit disappointing, it excludes local variables even if they are clearly in the scope of the function being queried (and even if those variables are captured)
2015-06-07 21:01:38	jshjsh	At least it's this way in luajit 2.0.4
2015-06-07 21:03:00	Neffiphone	getfenv changes the global environment. you can change locals with debug functions. see the manual

2015-06-07 21:04:49	Neffiphone	they handle up values
2015-06-07 21:04:55	jshjsh	actually if those do then it implies that non-captured variables get captured for the sake of that ... and might not get gced
2015-06-07 21:05:09	jshjsh	Well say a function foo has locals a and b
2015-06-07 21:05:25	jshjsh	and a closure called bar in it has locals c and d
2015-06-07 21:05:39	jshjsh	can I get a and b from bar?
2015-06-07 21:05:49	jshjsh	what if bar refers to a and b?
2015-06-07 21:06:28	cmtptr	bar can reference anything that's in scope when it's instantiated
2015-06-07 21:07:13	cmtptr	it will create a reference to any locals outside of it, closing over those locals (in lua they become something called upvalues)
2015-06-07 21:07:22	jshjsh	I know what bar can reference but what can get with getupvalue or getlocal
2015-06-07 21:07:36	cmtptr	it can get
2015-06-07 21:07:37	cmtptr	upvalues
2015-06-07 21:07:42	jshjsh	(I'm sure I don't really understand getlocal)
2015-06-07 21:07:48	cmtptr	I don't understand the question
2015-06-07 21:07:55	jshjsh	"upvalue" isn't a word used in computer science, just in Lua
2015-06-07 21:07:57	jshjsh	so it's a bit weird
2015-06-07 21:08:10	jshjsh	I'm not sure if "upvalue" means local
2015-06-07 21:08:21	cmtptr	it means a local that's been closed over
2015-06-07 21:08:40	jshjsh	ah, so a and b could be upvalues but c and d can't
2015-06-07 21:08:53	cmtptr	local a, b local function foo() local c, d end  -- here, a and b are upvalues, c and d are locals
2015-06-07 21:08:53	jshjsh	if b is referenced but a isn't then a isn't an upvalue?
2015-06-07 21:09:40	cmtptr	well, actually in my example a and b aren't upvalues because they're not referenced by foo, but you get the idea (I hope)
2015-06-07 21:09:54	jshjsh	it's a problem if upvalues that aren't actually referenced are captured, because then they can't be garbage collected if the closure still exists
2015-06-07 21:10:02	cmtptr	yes

2015-06-07 21:15:41	jshjsh	Yeah other not-obviously bad things that end up being bad are the everything is an object meaning that you migrate new features into the root object class
2015-06-07 21:15:42	nopcom1	it could be worse: you could have all the introspection *and* macros

2015-06-07 21:37:12	jshjsh	if you have to replace # with something complicated
2015-06-07 21:38:26	diginet	so, I'm trying to write a shell script to automatically launch the lua interpreter, and add a module to the _ENV metatable, so I don't have to manually give each function a shorter name, but it keeps complaining about not being able to find the file

2015-06-07 21:39:29	jshjsh	compile with -DLUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT
2015-06-07 21:39:32	diginet	specifically, I enter in the following command: lua -i "setmetatable(_ENV or _G, { __index = lpeg or require"lpeg" })"

2015-06-07 21:39:59	koz_	Or rather, if it's compiled with that or not.
2015-06-07 21:40:08	koz_	Otherwise I'll have to compile it myself.
2015-06-07 21:40:24	jshjsh	try a goto statement
2015-06-07 21:40:57	koz_	jshjsh: OK.
2015-06-07 21:41:08	lu324	diginet, lua -i -e 'lpeg=require"lpeg"'
2015-06-07 21:41:39	diginet	lu324: no, what I want to do is have it where I can call the lpeg functions, like R S P, by themselves
2015-06-07 21:41:51	diginet	or will that do that?
2015-06-07 21:42:15	koz_	jshjsh: Nope, definitely no such flag.
2015-06-07 21:42:20	lu324	diginet, then do what you did but with the -e
2015-06-07 21:42:25	koz_	Time to compile it myself. Sigh.
2015-06-07 21:42:25	jshjsh	something like local R,S,P=lpeg.R,lpeg.S,lpeg.P
2015-06-07 21:42:49	lu324	otherwise it expects the filename of a script
2015-06-07 21:42:50	jshjsh	with my setup I had to compile with a custom luaconf.h
2015-06-07 21:42:56	jshjsh	or whatever that's called
2015-06-07 21:43:12	jshjsh	because I'm using luadist and it uses non-standard paths
2015-06-07 21:43:27	jshjsh	Though you can also set the paths in environment variables
2015-06-07 21:43:36	diginet	lu324: what I'm confused, I used the -i option, not the -e option
2015-06-07 21:43:40	diginet	*wait
2015-06-07 21:44:05	jshjsh	are you using the latest version 2.0.4?
2015-06-07 21:44:12	diginet	oh what?
2015-06-07 21:44:25	jshjsh	Sorry, I was asking koz_
2015-06-07 21:44:29	diginet	ahh, np
2015-06-07 21:44:37	diginet	could I do: lua -llpeg -i "setmetatable(_ENV or _G, { __index = lpeg })"
2015-06-07 21:44:42	koz_	jshjsh: Yes.
2015-06-07 21:44:48	jshjsh	:3
2015-06-07 21:44:59	lu324	diginet, without -e , lua expects a filename, not code

2015-06-08 00:22:25	jshjsh	he actually got angry at a right wing presidential debate audience for the support for denying education to immigrants

2015-06-08 01:31:28	diginet	Star Trek sucks
2015-06-08 01:31:31	diginet	it all sucks
2015-06-08 01:31:37	diginet	the acting is awful
2015-06-08 01:31:42	technomancy	I mean the fact that they managed it at all is pretty remarkable
2015-06-08 01:31:43	diginet	the writing is awful
2015-06-08 01:31:51	diginet	 even for the time IMO
2015-06-08 01:32:00	diginet	it gets a pass because of nostalgia glasses

2015-06-08 01:55:08	ttmrichter	A VSOP Courvoisier.  Any good?
2015-06-08 01:55:16	diginet	I don't really care if people drink, but I don't want to be around it, and I don't want to do it...what is so controversial about that?
2015-06-08 01:55:17	Nihilumbra	Hi Alissa 
2015-06-08 01:55:39	Neffi	Nihilumbra: hey are you named after that WoW guild that got banned for blatantly cheating? 
2015-06-08 01:55:44	Alissa	Nihilumbra: :|
2015-06-08 01:55:50	cmtptr	diginet, I don't drink either buddy
2015-06-08 01:56:01	Neffi	but we love cmtptr for his other redeeming qualities 
2015-06-08 01:56:02	Neffi	like his cat
2015-06-08 01:56:17	diginet	I have two cats
2015-06-08 01:56:19	koz_	Who's the person responsible for Callisto?
2015-06-08 01:56:22	koz_	Because it seems good.
2015-06-08 01:56:24	Alissa	pfftsch. only two?
2015-06-08 01:56:25	Nihilumbra	kekekkek Alissa
2015-06-08 01:56:27	 *	Alissa has like 10
2015-06-08 01:56:33	diginet	lol
2015-06-08 01:56:35	lpghatguy	koz_, me?
2015-06-08 01:56:47	lpghatguy	Unless there's another Callisto because it's a super obvious name
2015-06-08 01:56:54	koz_	lpghatguy: That's a nice idea.
2015-06-08 01:57:08	koz_	What do the 'bang' methods do?
2015-06-08 01:57:32	lpghatguy	It's partly legacy cruft, it's going to translate ! to BANG probably
2015-06-08 01:57:44	lpghatguy	Right now it translates ! to InPlace since the language was yoinked out of my framework
2015-06-08 01:58:26	diginet	lpghatguy: I took a quick glance, that looks neat
2015-06-08 01:59:01	koz_	lpghatguy: Is it kinda like those methods in Scheme that end in !?
2015-06-08 01:59:19	diginet	Lua is nearly an ideal scripting language for me, there's just a few things I'd change, like making the assignment operator := and requiring declaration for all variables
2015-06-08 01:59:53	lpghatguy	koz_, it's intended to make things in-place, but it also just adds to the character set for method names
2015-06-08 01:59:55	cmtptr	lpghatguy, the question is: does callisto have any furq?
2015-06-08 02:00:14	lpghatguy	cmtptr, this project was actually going to be furqless-lua
2015-06-08 02:01:21	koz_	lpghatguy: Nice!
2015-06-08 02:01:48	Neffi	lpghatguy: Make furqless-lua the closed source counterpart in classic Google fashion 
2015-06-08 02:01:56	Neffi	with an EULA that says furq can't use it
2015-06-08 02:02:00	lpghatguy	Alright, made that fix, Bang!() now translates to BangBANG()
2015-06-08 02:02:18	lpghatguy	it's still kind of awkward since Method:Bang!() and Method["Bang!"]() aren't the same thing
2015-06-08 02:02:43	Neffi	lpghatguy: where is the page for Callisto?
2015-06-08 02:02:53	lpghatguy	Neffi, https://github.com/lua-carbon/callisto
2015-06-08 02:03:55	cmtptr	diginet, := is not correct for assignment
2015-06-08 02:04:08	diginet	cmtptr: why?
2015-06-08 02:04:14	diginet	I vastly prefer it to =
2015-06-08 02:04:20	Neffi	lpghatguy: What are bang methods. Never dealt with something like that. 
2015-06-08 02:04:20	cmtptr	because := indicates definition
2015-06-08 02:04:43	lpghatguy	Neffi, Bang! translates to BangBANG in Callisto, or BangInPlace in legacy mode
2015-06-08 02:04:56	diginet	cmtptr: you mean like in EBNF? Isn't that generally ::=? In any case, the Pascal languages always use := for assignment and = for definition
2015-06-08 02:05:00	Neffi	lpghatguy: what is the meaning of this though? what is the significance? 
2015-06-08 02:05:06	lpghatguy	just a character set extension intending to promote in-place operations a la Ruby
2015-06-08 02:05:17	Neffi	I don't know Ruby 
2015-06-08 02:05:32	lpghatguy	vec:normalize!() would normalize in place, for example
2015-06-08 02:05:50	Neffi	whereas vec:normalize() returns a new vector object? 
2015-06-08 02:06:04	lpghatguy	Perhaps!
2015-06-08 02:06:09	Neffi	ok I see
2015-06-08 02:06:11	lpghatguy	It's not a mutating method, which is the important part
2015-06-08 02:06:41	Neffi	number++ seems entirely superfluous
2015-06-08 02:06:44	lpghatguy	right now it only works for bang methods and definitions, but I think I'll expand it
2015-06-08 02:06:49	Neffi	why not just tell users to do number += 1?
2015-06-08 02:06:50	lpghatguy	Neffi, isn't this all superfluous?
2015-06-08 02:06:59	lpghatguy	Yeah, I'm goign to get rid of that before the first release
2015-06-08 02:07:00	Neffi	yes but there's a balance somewhere
2015-06-08 02:07:03	lpghatguy	gotta keep it for legacy mode
2015-06-08 02:07:15	Neffi	and ++ has always seemed on the wrong end of that balance to me
2015-06-08 02:07:34	Neffi	also how do you solve compound operators metamethod invocation?

2015-06-08 02:09:01	lpghatguy	It'll invoke a's __index and __newindex and b's __add
2015-06-08 02:09:06	cmtptr	I imagine he compiles that to a.b = a.b + 1
2015-06-08 02:09:06	Neffi	ok
2015-06-08 02:09:07	lpghatguy	and, err
2015-06-08 02:09:12	lpghatguy	cmtptr, yeah, it's pretty simple
2015-06-08 02:09:36	lpghatguy	I might eventually fold it to local _SCRAP=a.b; a.b = _SCRAP + 1
2015-06-08 02:09:38	Neffi	compound assignment ops are like the one thing I've been hoping for in Lua
2015-06-08 02:09:45	Neffi	because we tend to abuse tables a lot
2015-06-08 02:09:54	lpghatguy	yeah, and we have long reference names
2015-06-08 02:10:01	Neffi	I'm not sure I like the "Compound named array lookups" part
2015-06-08 02:10:11	lpghatguy	It's my favorite part
2015-06-08 02:10:18	Neffi	The whole 'xyz' thing seems very ... what's the word
2015-06-08 02:10:22	Neffi	it should be more generalized

2015-06-08 02:10:49	lpghatguy	The generalized form is x~>3 or unpack(x)
2015-06-08 02:11:08	Neffi	~>? 
2015-06-08 02:11:17	lpghatguy	It's going to be a compile-time fixed-length unpack
2015-06-08 02:11:21	cmtptr	sperm operator
2015-06-08 02:11:24	lpghatguy	yep
2015-06-08 02:11:53	Neffi	so x, y, z = vec~>3?
2015-06-08 02:11:57	lpghatguy	Yep!
2015-06-08 02:12:04	 *	Neffi shrugs
2015-06-08 02:12:10	lpghatguy	The regular compound array lookups let you swizzle and stuff too
2015-06-08 02:12:29	lpghatguy	vec->yyy and vec->wzyx are both valid and nice
2015-06-08 02:12:48	Neffi	I also don't see the point of short form for lambdas. a function literal is already short enough. 
2015-06-08 02:12:59	Neffi	but default function arguments are not a terrible thing
2015-06-08 02:13:21	technomancy	Neffi: I have my editor render "function" as λ anyway
2015-06-08 02:13:28	Neffi	wat
2015-06-08 02:13:38	lpghatguy	'function(a, b) return a < b end' is a bit more verbose than '(a, b) => a < b' when you're using lots of delegates and stuff
2015-06-08 02:13:41	technomancy	"function" is like 8 chars
2015-06-08 02:13:45	technomancy	too many
2015-06-08 02:13:46	Neffi	so? 
2015-06-08 02:13:51	lpghatguy	table.sort({3, 1, 2}, (a, b) => a < b) is pretty slick
2015-06-08 02:14:00	technomancy	in clojure it's just "fn" and "fun" in erlang
2015-06-08 02:14:01	ttmrichter	Neffi: There already are default function arguments.  "nil" is the default to any argument not provided!  :D
2015-06-08 02:14:09	Neffi	oh you
2015-06-08 02:14:34	technomancy	Neffi: it's still "function" on disk, so it's only me who's seeing the nicer abbreviation
2015-06-08 02:14:43	Neffi	'nicer' 
2015-06-08 02:14:46	ttmrichter	Of course now you're motivating me to make a module that permits you to supply argument defaults without making a new language...
2015-06-08 02:15:09	lpghatguy	ttmrichter, what's wrong with 'local x = (x ~= nil) and x or DEFAULT'?
2015-06-08 02:15:19	Neffi	ttmrichter: how would you work such a thing? 
2015-06-08 02:15:28	lpghatguy	Neffi, those array lookups are also nice for things like LOVE too
2015-06-08 02:15:30	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: Too verbose.
2015-06-08 02:15:35	lpghatguy	ttmrichter, then use callisto!
2015-06-08 02:15:38	ttmrichter	Neffi: Same way I've added type checking to arguments.
2015-06-08 02:15:54	Neffi	o.o
2015-06-08 02:15:56	lpghatguy	I'm throwing in typechecking to arguments in Callisto someday
2015-06-08 02:15:58	ttmrichter	Wrapper functions.

2015-06-08 02:17:19	lpghatguy	Neffi, yep, and when you're referencing it as "self.position" it's kind of nice
2015-06-08 02:17:20	Neffi	;)
2015-06-08 02:17:25	ttmrichter	Neffi: Because it's in a single line.
2015-06-08 02:17:48	ttmrichter	When it's done up as a block of code with proper line separation and indenting it's just fine.
2015-06-08 02:18:04	ttmrichter	And it's a whole lot less ugly than what it's a wrapper for (which is essentially a bunch of asserts).
2015-06-08 02:18:09	Neffi	i should go to bed

2015-06-08 02:18:45	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: Yeah, but has the advantage of working in plain Lua, not in a dialect that removes what few bits of Lua are out there for community source.
2015-06-08 02:19:05	lpghatguy	Not unlike JavaScript supersets, but dang do I love those
2015-06-08 02:19:21	lpghatguy	I think Lua is already fragmented enough with LuaJIT/5.1/5.2/5.3
2015-06-08 02:19:25	ttmrichter	I don't like anything that is even peripherally associated with JavaScript.
2015-06-08 02:19:31	jshjsh	I suppose there are fsetenv tricks for making it so that you don't need "self." for instance variables... but I'm always afraid that those will slow luajit down too much
2015-06-08 02:19:43	lpghatguy	jshjsh, and... no 5.2?

2015-06-08 02:20:10	jshjsh	luajit is already 10 times faster than lua right?
2015-06-08 02:20:18	lpghatguy	at least?
2015-06-08 02:20:28	lpghatguy	It's like 100 times faster in a lot of cases, or as slow as only 3x faster
2015-06-08 02:20:30	ttmrichter	Neffi: Still a lot more verbose than my decorator strings.
2015-06-08 02:20:51	Neffi	yes, but it strikes a good balance of verbosity and simplicity 
2015-06-08 02:20:57	ttmrichter	Neffi: *AND* my decorator strings allow for user-defined types and type checking functions.
2015-06-08 02:21:07	lpghatguy	Neffi, it's not much nicer than just using an assert?

2015-06-08 02:21:27	Neffi	lpghatguy: what if you need to assert against multiple types? 
2015-06-08 02:21:33	lpghatguy	use an or
2015-06-08 02:21:45	jshjsh	it's amazing that luajit is as good as it is, considering how little lua gives it
2015-06-08 02:22:01	ttmrichter	lpghatguy: Asserts also don't give you the nice ability to point to where in the stack the error likely lies.
2015-06-08 02:22:11	Neffi	assert(type(val) == 'number' or type(val) == 'string' or type(val) == 'nil', 'bad argument n to f (number/string/nil expected, got '..type(val)..')')  -- look how fucking long that is
2015-06-08 02:22:12	lpghatguy	jshjsh, and it's one of the fastest JIT-compiled dynamic languages out there
2015-06-08 02:22:27	Neffi	also what ttmrichter said
2015-06-08 02:22:34	Neffi	if you want that you need to use an if-block with error()
2015-06-08 02:22:38	lpghatguy	Neffi, function(val: [number, string, nil]) BAM
2015-06-08 02:22:38	Neffi	which is even uglier and bulkier

2015-06-08 02:23:19	jshjsh	maybe the assembler is in lua?
2015-06-08 02:23:21	lpghatguy	It's hand-written in pure assembly for every platform
2015-06-08 02:23:37	jshjsh	It doesn't have a masm file that I can debug
2015-06-08 02:23:39	jshjsh	or something like that
2015-06-08 02:23:39	Neffi	The interpreter is in assembly. The JIT compiler is in C, afaik. 
2015-06-08 02:23:50	jshjsh	I don't mind the interpreter being in assembly
2015-06-08 02:23:54	lpghatguy	and... yeah, I think the assembler for the assembly+C mix files are in Lua
2015-06-08 02:23:58	Neffi	I havent peaked much into the code, but it's not all assembly 
2015-06-08 02:23:59	jshjsh	I mind that it's not in a standard assembly format

2015-06-08 02:24:30	jshjsh	there's some comment saying they did that for windows because they didn't want to require windows users to have an assembler installed
2015-06-08 02:25:05	lpghatguy	mike pall is a genius
2015-06-08 02:25:09	lpghatguy	I'm sure it was the right decision

It has no value whatsoever without extra information being present to indicate what that "truth" is.  So you're going to be storing that with X among other things anyway.  So stop storing the X and just use whatever it was you were testing in the first place.

2015-06-08 02:57:44	ttmrichter	Well, that's a separate issue.  I like to take a cue from languages like Icon there.
2015-06-08 02:58:01	ttmrichter	Functions/procedures/subroutines/whatever can "pass" or "fail" in addition to generating values.

2015-06-08 21:32:42	jshjsh	also, what's your target
2015-06-08 21:33:05	jshjsh	wxwidgets is for windows, osx and linux
2015-06-08 21:33:24	jshjsh	doesn't support android or ipad

2015-06-08 21:40:35	Viibit	actually I don't know if they're actual libraries, legacy.lua, profile.lua, rcf.lua and serialize.lua
2015-06-08 21:40:38	daurnimator	qt is doable... but unmaintained at the moment
2015-06-08 21:40:53	daurnimator	Viibit: those aren't gui libraries I know of. (I doubt they are)
2015-06-08 21:41:02	Viibit	and the main folder has a bunch of dlls
2015-06-08 21:41:05	Viibit	Dam
2015-06-08 21:41:23	daurnimator	Viibit: dlls. so you're on windows?
2015-06-08 21:41:30	jshjsh	does it wx.dll?
2015-06-08 21:41:36	jshjsh	that's wxlua

2015-06-08 21:44:24	jshjsh	there's probably a great lua thing for iphone, though maybe slow because apple is paranoid about jits

2015-06-08 22:05:55	paulk3	jshjsh, nopcom1, yes, I do build wxlua, but I use my own (self-sufficient) scripts; no homebrew
2015-06-08 22:05:59	jshjsh	One of these years I'm tempted to see if you can build a smalltalk like environment with code browsers and the like with WXLUA
2015-06-08 22:06:06	nopcom1	I thought, "ah, I'll use LuaDist" and then it bombed out on libtiff
2015-06-08 22:06:28	jshjsh	luadist seems old and abandon ;_:
2015-06-08 22:06:37	nopcom1	paulk3: I suppose I could do it the old fashioned way
2015-06-08 22:07:09	nopcom1	thanks
2015-06-08 22:07:16	paulk3	the build scripts are included in ZeroBrane Studio; in the build/ folder
2015-06-08 22:07:28	jshjsh	paulk3 are you interested in wxlua built against wxwidgets 3.0.2 - I'm running that now and Zerobrane runs fine in it
2015-06-08 22:07:31	paulk3	but they use the structure specific to ZBS; shouldn't be difficult to adapt
2015-06-08 22:07:45	jshjsh	but I don't know wx well enough to know if I broke anything
2015-06-08 22:07:53	nopcom1	as long as it's not a meta-meta-build system, I'll be fine
2015-06-08 22:08:10	paulk3	jshjsh, yes, I do plan to upgrade, but there are some issues to resolve: https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues/260
2015-06-08 22:08:30	paulk3	nopcom1, no, it's plain old bash scripts ;); but wxlua requires cmake
2015-06-08 22:08:36	jshjsh	One thing I noticed is that I had to turn off some optimizations.  I compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing and -fno-strict-overflow
2015-06-08 22:08:50	jshjsh	and I had to turn off wx asserts
2015-06-08 22:09:00	jshjsh	otherwise zerobrane starts with two asserts
2015-06-08 22:09:11	nopcom1	ow
2015-06-08 22:09:14	paulk3	hm, it was failing? usually asserts point to things that may work, but better be fixed
2015-06-08 22:09:44	paulk3	jshjsh, any idea what those asserts were? I compiled on Windows, but didn't see any there... what was the OS?
2015-06-08 22:10:23	jshjsh	I'll look at my notes

2015-06-09 10:25:26	Spacemonkey	twat
2015-06-09 10:25:37	furq	it's a script that creates a noncompliant deb package
2015-06-09 10:25:42	harisk92	yes
2015-06-09 10:25:44	furq	or rpm package i guess but rpm is for scrubs

2015-06-09 10:26:40	furq	ttmrichter: if you're installing something on debian and there's no package you can run `checkinstall make install` and it'll (supposedly) create a deb
2015-06-09 10:26:43	furq	so that you can uninstall it

2015-06-09 12:18:24	cmtptr	imagine you have a simple program with three functions, a, b, and c.  a calls b, and b calls c, and then you freeze the program state in the middle of c.  the call stack would look like this (bottom of the stack on the left): [local variables and arguments for a] [local variables and args for b] [local variables and args for c]

2015-06-11 00:17:03	TheWorld1	yeah, I was just hoping I wouldn't have to add lua to my path :<
2015-06-11 00:17:20	Neffi	You should launch your script via the command line. Ideally you should add Lua to your PATH; the Lua for Windows installer may have already done that for you. Then you can just launch the command prompt, navigate to the folder where the file is and type like "lua file.lua" 
2015-06-11 00:17:40	cehteh	uhm i just tied luaforwindows in a vm .. thats seriously a lua 5.1?
2015-06-11 00:17:45	TheWorld1	Oh, lol
2015-06-11 00:17:46	Neffi	Alternately you could right-click the .lua file and associate that file with the Lua executable. Open with -> navigate to lua.exe and select it
2015-06-11 00:17:52	TheWorld1	I guess the installer did it already
2015-06-11 00:17:59	TheWorld1	sorry to bother you guys :D
2015-06-11 00:17:59	Neffi	also, lastly, I don't recommend Lua for Windows 
2015-06-11 00:18:10	Neffi	they like to ship outright broken builds
2015-06-11 00:18:13	TheWorld1	Whats wrong with Lua for windows?
2015-06-11 00:18:15	Neffi	use luaforge lua binaries

2015-06-11 00:19:45	Neffi	it's just Lua, no extra libs. if you want extra libs, dont wanna build, and luaforwindows works for you, then by all means keep it. 
2015-06-11 00:20:15	daurnimator	I would recommend the lua that comes with the luarocks installer

2015-06-11 23:29:05	ThomQ	itkor: I got both :P
2015-06-11 23:29:31	bone	how would it not? if you're running a non windows application, you'll get a command prompt.
2015-06-11 23:29:53	ThomQ	itkor it still makes it popup
2015-06-11 23:30:20	daurnimator	bone: I just saw http://stackoverflow.com/a/29650882/282536
2015-06-11 23:30:53	ThomQ	I got a way though. I manually moved the CMD to the bottom right of my screen and set the default position there (rightclick window bar -> defaults). The popup is hardly noticable, fits my needs exactly :)
2015-06-11 23:31:12	ThomQ	Now i just gotta drag it when i want to manually use it, but that isnt on a day to day basis
2015-06-11 23:31:46	daurnimator	heh. interesting workaround
2015-06-11 23:32:06	itkor	io.popen didn't work?
2015-06-11 23:32:29	ThomQ	itkor, it still popped up
2015-06-11 23:34:12	ThomQ	wait, it might not
2015-06-11 23:34:16	ThomQ	:D hold on
2015-06-11 23:35:53	ThomQ	yeah no, its still popping up, even with the stack overflow answer
2015-06-11 23:36:22	bone	if the guy on stackoverflow tested it with the normal lua interpreter, he's already got a console attached, so the output was just captured there.
2015-06-11 23:37:10	bone	it doesn't work, the window still opens.  easy to see via test.wlua on windows (which runs it from a windows gui program rather than console)

2015-06-12 19:54:13	Neffi	KimmyK9: Have you tried consulting the manual on patterns? 
2015-06-12 19:54:56	Neffi	You've already asked us for a slightly different pattern. Presumably you are working on something which will require more patterns like this. Instead of asking us every time, you should try to nail down how patterns work. See http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.4 (and the next section, 6.4.1)
2015-06-12 19:54:56	KimmyK9	yes im not getting anywhere: /
2015-06-12 19:54:59	KimmyK9	im trying to learn
2015-06-12 19:55:17	KimmyK9	ive been experimenting for over 2 hours
2015-06-12 19:55:52	Neffi	Well I'll start you out with a basic pattern for what you asked. Then, read it against the manual entry I just linked you and try to figure out what's going on. ;) 
2015-06-12 19:56:08	KimmyK9	thats the page ive been reading
2015-06-12 19:56:28	KimmyK9	: / im not the brightest, i just need 1 working example on this one

2015-06-12 19:57:20	Neffi	"start by looking for /, then match everything after it that's NOT a `[` character, and then there'll be a `[` character after"
2015-06-12 19:57:24	Neffi	is what that pattern says
2015-06-12 19:58:16	Neffi	the use of % escapes may make it look a little hard to read 
2015-06-12 19:58:33	KimmyK9	yea thats where i get confused
2015-06-12 19:59:09	Neffi	take it step by step, ask what an individual character means, and experiment by changing that and see the result 
2015-06-12 20:00:05	Neffi	Patterns and things like it are not eminently readable because they're very informationally dense, but break it down into its constituant parts and you see it's actually very simple

2015-06-13 14:11:57	Neffi	x10A94: It's not guaranteed to return exactly the error message "error in error handling" and you shouldn't depend on that. Just check if the first return is 'false' and then you know it failed.

2015-06-13 14:14:53	Neffi	also yes if you want to know if the error handler failed, it looks like you do have to match the error message. the first return indicated the success of the calling function, not the errhandler
2015-06-13 14:15:29	furq	but that error message is not mandated in the spec! what if you want it to be portable?? you might die

2015-06-13 17:25:08	diginet	lpghatguy: that's a contrived example. I'm trying to write a grammar for a very simple language, which can infer the type of values. So I would pre-process something "myvar := red" to "myvar : color := red"
2015-06-13 17:25:20	diginet	if that makes sense
2015-06-13 17:25:37	lpghatguy	I think you should try to do that in your regular pass
2015-06-13 17:25:59	lpghatguy	If you have your type as as an optional field and you find zero characters (or only spaces) then you should know that you want to infer the type
2015-06-13 17:26:27	diginet	lpghatguy: well that was a poor example I guess, really I just need to annotate the AST with the type
2015-06-13 17:26:49	lpghatguy	I still think you can do that
2015-06-13 17:27:09	diginet	{myvar = {type = "color", value="red"}}
2015-06-13 17:27:11	diginet	something like that

2015-06-14 13:02:08	furq	Zarutian: why should it
2015-06-14 13:02:11	ttmrichter	Why doesn't Lua support unification, backtracking, and non-determinism?
2015-06-14 13:02:14	furq	ttmrichter: why should it
2015-06-14 13:02:17	furq	see how good this is
2015-06-14 13:02:26	Gevox	furq: that was a basic thing and almost everyone knwos those operators
2015-06-14 13:02:26	x10A94	Why doesn't Lua bring me beer?
2015-06-14 13:02:28	ttmrichter	It truly is the universal answer.
2015-06-14 13:02:30	Gevox	easier and shorter
2015-06-14 13:02:51	ttmrichter	Gevox: You read code 10 to 100 times more often than you type it.
2015-06-14 13:02:52	Zarutian	furq: indeed. I prefere ex nihilo object creation and trait mixing in constuctor _functions_
2015-06-14 13:03:06	furq	x10A94: why should it
2015-06-14 13:03:09	ttmrichter	Is it really worth saving a few keystrokes just out of laziness?
2015-06-14 13:03:23	x10A94	furq, it was a joke.
2015-06-14 13:03:24	x10A94	Well..
2015-06-14 13:03:27	ttmrichter	furq: Because x10A94 would really like a beer.
2015-06-14 13:03:31	furq	good answer
2015-06-14 13:03:45	furq	but what has x10A94 done to deserve a free beer delivery service
2015-06-14 13:03:57	x10A94	Typing superlongname["somethingelse"]++ is better than writing it verbosely, though
2015-06-14 13:04:07	Zarutian	ttmrichter: indeed. But I have the converse question: is it worth writing so much boiler plate/dead letters?
2015-06-14 13:04:46	furq	i like how people say "oh we need increment operators so i don't have to type foo.bar.baz.quux.piss.waa = foo.bar.baz.quux.piss.waa + 1"
2015-06-14 13:04:46	Gevox	ttmrichter: when you are incrementing a variable inside a table or two sometimes its better not only to save some keystrokes but shorter variables
2015-06-14 13:04:47	ttmrichter	Zarutian: Yes.  It sends stupid people away from your language because it doesn't look like C.
2015-06-14 13:04:54	furq	as if that's a common thing to have to do
2015-06-14 13:04:54	x10A94	Eh. If I wanted to use increment, I'd just make require into a custom function that gsubs [%w_-]++ with %1=%1+1
2015-06-14 13:05:23	xyzzy_	which has problems
2015-06-14 13:05:24	Zarutian	ttmrichter: I meant boilerplating like in Java (which mostly doesnt __do_ anything)
2015-06-14 13:05:40	ttmrichter	Zarutian: Oh, fuck no.  There's a reason why I don't use Java or C++ or their ilk ever.
2015-06-14 13:06:12	Zarutian	ttmrichter: indeed ;-)
2015-06-14 13:07:57	ttmrichter	If I absolutely must, I'll use C out of that family.  That's about it.

2015-06-14 16:31:56	lpeghatguy	mniip, I found an example of a BNF transformation on the Lua source that doesn't use left-recursion
2015-06-14 16:33:06	mniip	it probably uses fold continuations that need to be post-processed
2015-06-14 16:33:52	mniip	read: you have to do extra work on the AST
2015-06-14 16:36:24	x10A94	So I made a webserver using just Lua and luasocket. It's great.
2015-06-14 16:37:15	x10A94	So: how do I know whether the file was updated with new data?
2015-06-14 16:37:32	lpeghatguy	mniip, my grammar is no longer left-recursive and LPeg doesn't throw up, so that's something
2015-06-14 16:37:42	sztanpet	depends on the os and its never racefree x10A94 
2015-06-14 16:37:52	x10A94	Using Love2d here.

2015-06-14 16:38:19	sztanpet	just poll it
2015-06-14 16:38:24	x10A94	Well yeah, because I was too lazy to set up luasocket for standalone

2015-06-14 17:19:56	Taoki	Hello. What is the easiest way to extract an integer percentage from a value based on another value? For example: tretshold = 100. In this case: for x = 50, result is 0. For x = 100, result is 1. For x = 150, result is still 1. For x = 200, result is 2. For x 0 678, result is 6. And so on.
2015-06-14 17:20:12	Taoki	But the treshold can be any value, not necessarily one ending in 0. Like 75
2015-06-14 17:20:25	Taoki	x can also be anything... from 10 to 10000

2015-06-15 00:16:49	jshjsh	"bc features"?
2015-06-15 00:16:54	xyzzy_	the former of which includes goto support
2015-06-15 00:17:04	jshjsh	All I know is that I enable 5.2 features when I build it
2015-06-15 00:17:20	jshjsh	and someone was complaining the other day that he was using luajit and there was no goto
2015-06-15 00:17:41	xyzzy_	well if he somehow was using luajit 1.x then he'd be right
2015-06-15 00:18:06	jshjsh	Also I noticed that luajit 2.1 branch doesn't allow a label after a return

2015-06-15 00:19:23	xyzzy_	presumably that would need the 5.2 flag

2015-06-15 00:19:57	jshjsh	maybe, though the official doc for 5.2 has a grammar that looks like a label after a return wouldn't be legal

2015-06-15 00:53:10	jshjsh	My idea is this.  In an extendable grammar you may not know that failing a bit of parse is an error immediately
2015-06-15 00:53:30	jshjsh	because someone could have added a production that DOES continue what you just failed
2015-06-15 00:53:49	jshjsh	so say you find goto but what comes after it isn't a label
2015-06-15 00:53:54	jshjsh	instead of throwing an error
2015-06-15 00:54:17	jshjsh	you SUGGEST an error at the token position where the label name was expected
2015-06-15 00:54:34	jshjsh	if something eats that token, then the error is erased
2015-06-15 00:54:58	jshjsh	if nothing eats that token then it will report the meaningful error on the uneaten token

2015-06-15 02:35:10	jshjsh	the catch is that since it's based on backtracking that's happening WHILE you're doing your parsing
2015-06-15 02:35:22	jshjsh	you can do work and then have to throw it away
2015-06-15 02:35:32	jshjsh	because that part of the parse failed.
2015-06-15 02:35:51	jshjsh	in prolog, backtracking and throwing your work away as if it never happened is "free"
2015-06-15 02:36:17	jshjsh	it's just a much simpler model to program to
2015-06-15 02:36:56	jshjsh	in its simplest form it's like peg that never commits
2015-06-15 02:37:25	jshjsh	so that there's no "language hiding" where if one parse succeeds, it can't try alternates with the same name
2015-06-15 02:37:50	jshjsh	if you want it to commit like a peg you have to explicitly put a cut in

2015-06-15 02:52:06	jshjsh	as long as you don't mind committing, as lpegs do then you don't have any problem with the result being exponential ... I think

2015-06-15 19:39:47	mniip	well it depends on the university I guess
2015-06-15 19:40:01	mniip	but in russia spoken exams are common
2015-06-15 19:40:03	furq	it means that you're allowed to rape people as long as you're good at football

2015-06-15 19:45:49	Veltas	Er I guess Zermelo-Fraenkel since that's what we were taught
2015-06-15 19:46:02	Veltas	In fact it was more sort of Zermelo-Fraenkel Lite
2015-06-15 19:46:13	Veltas	"Please register in 60 days" etc.
2015-06-15 19:46:25	mniip	Veltas, ZFC?
2015-06-15 19:46:32	mniip	or without the C
2015-06-15 19:46:44	Veltas	Yes
2015-06-15 19:46:55	Veltas	According to Wikipedia that is another way of saying that
2015-06-15 19:46:57	koz_	Veltas: ZFC is super-standard.
2015-06-15 19:47:12	koz_	To be honest, *really* getting axiomatic set theory is a painful process.
2015-06-15 19:47:24	koz_	So the fact it was a 'lite' version comes as little surprise.
2015-06-15 19:47:58	Veltas	Er yeah we were made to understand that there was really more pain involved, and we got a taste of it. But we didn't go into it, we mainly looked at 'results'
2015-06-15 19:47:59	koz_	My encounters with logic are mostly because my Master's supervisor is a model theorist.

2015-06-15 19:51:06	koz_	Classes mostly exist because of NBG and having to deal with stuff like 'the set of all sets is a contradiction'.
2015-06-15 19:51:28	koz_	Heck, if it weren't for Cohen, NBG, not ZFC, would become the dominant set theory of today.

2015-06-15 19:54:55	furq	use whatever archive format you want
2015-06-15 19:55:01	furq	you can use no compression with 7z and rar

2015-06-15 19:55:30	Veltas	Well I say .tar because that implies no compression
2015-06-15 19:55:33	furq	because you can add parity to rar files
2015-06-15 19:55:34	mniip	but I don't see a problem with P(x) = x(0) == x(1)
2015-06-15 19:55:42	furq	which is useful when you're going to be uploading them to the internet
2015-06-15 19:55:45	furq	especially the chinese internet
2015-06-15 19:55:46	mniip	which is a predicate over predicates
2015-06-15 19:56:33	koz_	mniip: FOL is just short for first-order logic.
2015-06-15 19:56:45	koz_	And it's just propositional logic + predicates + quantification

2015-06-15 22:05:26	daurnimator	Getty: generally you don't want/need a string split/explode routing. an iterator (i.e. gmatch) is often better to work with
2015-06-15 22:05:47	Getty	yeah in this case it isnt, i need them in a table to work with them in the further flow
2015-06-15 22:06:02	Getty	like the player gies in a comand: /bla arg and i check for cmd[1] == /bla and stuff
2015-06-15 22:06:25	Getty	there might be more cool structures but right now its pretty handy cause i can also put in the middle a block for non-admins to block out commands
2015-06-15 22:06:36	Getty	so in my case it is handy to have it in a table, i do admit its not the norm
2015-06-15 22:07:07	daurnimator	Getty: so just use string.gmatch and fill up a table :)
2015-06-15 22:07:09	Getty	https://gist.github.com/Getty/99aaa436a94e4b3d0e6c here is btw the split function i have, does it look awkward?

2015-06-15 22:08:32	daurnimator	Getty: lua has a small standard library; it's often better to compose your own custom tools out of the building blocks available than to have thousands of functions ready to go that no one can ever remember which is which
2015-06-15 22:08:48	Getty	yeah but its like really annoying deep here, this stuf fi would really like prepackaged

2015-06-15 22:10:36	daurnimator	Getty: because I don't know what you wanted..... if someone gets a newline (enter) in the middle of the command string... what do you want to happen
2015-06-15 22:10:50	daurnimator	or possibly more likely: a tab.
2015-06-15 22:11:08	Getty	i actually dont know if they can type tab at all ;) i mean " " is probably fine
2015-06-15 22:11:20	Getty	i just asked back as its uncommon to write " "
2015-06-15 22:11:34	daurnimator	Getty: but generally, with what you're doing. I will just split off the first "dispatching" token and punt the rest to another method
2015-06-15 22:12:03	Getty	yeah i might go that way, so far its a lot of ... preparing that makes it a bti annoying to make it down a method

2015-06-17 20:43:39	KWhat_Work	furq: I am using this in redis, so I am not sure how much more i can give :(
2015-06-17 20:44:07	KWhat_Work	Neffi, redis executes it and says it returned (empty list or set)
2015-06-17 20:44:17	Neffi	is it using #? 
2015-06-17 20:44:33	Neffi	because the length of that table is certainly 0 
2015-06-17 20:45:03	KWhat_Work	thats a good question, idk 
2015-06-17 20:45:07	cmtptr	not unlike neffi's manhood
2015-06-17 20:45:20	furq	i thought that was -1

2015-06-17 20:45:58	furq	good luck
2015-06-17 20:46:17	furq	KWhat_Work: lists and sets both appear to be arrays
2015-06-17 20:46:27	furq	so it's not surprising that redis thinks that table is empty
2015-06-17 20:47:08	KWhat_Work	hmmm
2015-06-17 20:47:17	KWhat_Work	yah #items == 0
2015-06-17 20:47:30	KWhat_Work	so how do you add items to a table
2015-06-17 20:47:41	furq	t[1] = 10
2015-06-17 20:47:53	furq	or items = { 10 }
2015-06-17 20:48:19	furq	also for the sake of clarity you were already adding an item to a table, just not to the array part

2015-06-17 20:50:41	furq	it doesn't seem to do the thing you want it to do
2015-06-17 20:51:13	KWhat_Work	well I am just testing right now, phpredis claims i can return a table 
2015-06-17 20:51:33	KWhat_Work	i guess that doesn't apply to the cli 
2015-06-17 20:51:50	furq	tables are arrays and hashes
2015-06-17 20:52:07	KWhat_Work	can i do just a hash ?
2015-06-17 20:52:23	furq	that's what you were doing in that paste

2015-06-17 22:18:20	FatalNIX	How are coroutines usually handled from C? Not that I am doing it this way, but let's say you dofile some script, and the first line is coroutine.yield(), what happens?
2015-06-17 22:20:02	furq	%? lua_resume
2015-06-17 22:20:02	yalb	furq: http://lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#lua_resume
2015-06-17 22:20:40	FatalNIX	 yeah I read that
2015-06-17 22:21:06	FatalNIX	I'm a bit confused by it
2015-06-17 22:22:18	furq	if you mean a script calls coroutine.yield() from the main thread, it'll throw an error
2015-06-17 22:22:35	furq	you can't yield from the main thread
2015-06-17 22:22:44	FatalNIX	it doesn't.. plus I've never seen it happen?
2015-06-17 22:22:49	FatalNIX	I did it as a test to see
2015-06-17 22:23:00	furq	% coroutine.yield()

2015-06-17 22:23:11	FatalNIX	interesting

2015-06-19 22:51:02	cmtptr	I thought you got that way earlier
2015-06-19 22:51:11	furq	you get two life max ups and then poison mist and a ruby circlet
2015-06-19 22:51:16	furq	and a heart max up
2015-06-19 22:51:28	furq	also i beat him for the loss of 150 hp
2015-06-19 22:51:36	furq	although i admit it took four attempts
2015-06-19 22:51:54	cmtptr	oh the heart max up, the most important item in the game
2015-06-19 22:52:04	furq	i accidentally did qcf + lh when i went off to do the spike room
2015-06-19 22:52:10	furq	i had no idea it existed at all

2015-06-19 22:52:37	furq	so i just did that for 1.5 MP bars and he died
2015-06-19 22:52:54	furq	by which i mean i used all my mana, then used a mana prism
2015-06-19 22:53:29	furq	oh it's specific to the alucard sword

2015-06-19 22:55:40	cmtptr	what is it
2015-06-19 22:55:48	daurnimator	I just learnt that using a primitive as a 'this' will end up converting it to an Object     (function() { console.log(typeof this, this) }).call(2) ==> object Number {[[PrimitiveValue]]: 2} undefined
2015-06-19 22:55:49	furq	was that to me or him
2015-06-19 22:55:53	cmtptr	you
2015-06-19 22:56:20	furq	if you do qcf + attack with the alucard sword you teleport across the screen, turn around, attack twice and teleport back
2015-06-19 22:56:26	furq	but you can do it again before the teleport back animation is complete
2015-06-19 22:56:30	furq	and you're invincible while you do it
2015-06-19 22:56:44	furq	it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere and i did it by accident by fatfingering

2015-06-20 21:08:52	furq	well it has to be there, but there are no string arguments to file:read() which don't begin with a *

2015-06-20 21:16:50	cmtptr	it is deterministic
2015-06-20 21:17:18	cmtptr	and if you give read() a number argument it means "read up to this many bytes"
2015-06-20 21:17:48	cmtptr	and using strings for arguments is more or less the same as using enums
2015-06-20 21:18:09	cmtptr	the difference is just that one is surrounded in ""

2015-06-21 13:22:48	Alissa	Not well enough.
2015-06-21 13:22:56	Alissa	So does your Perl engine let you require() other C libraries?
2015-06-21 13:23:16	FatalNIX	nope
2015-06-21 13:23:16	Alissa	And tell us the output of printing package.cpath / package.path in your engine, then in stock Lua.
2015-06-21 13:23:19	FatalNIX	er
2015-06-21 13:23:28	FatalNIX	well I havent tried requiring other C libs no

2015-06-21 13:25:20	FatalNIX	okay, I have figured it out (what causes it)
2015-06-21 13:26:16	FatalNIX	it appears that its because it cant find the file, I just successfullyt required a file so it seems by changing the path in the argument to require, so my assumption is that for some reason I am just not getting the error.

2015-06-21 13:32:14	bone	ichimaru: okay you can do that with userdata and an OO syntax, or by using cclosures like you said.
2015-06-21 13:32:20	furq	from what, chinese doctors?
2015-06-21 13:32:29	ttmrichter	furq: The ears are where you put your pencils, duh!

2015-06-21 13:32:48	ttmrichter	And that's more per day than per year.
2015-06-21 13:32:49	bone	instead of newlib, you can simply write a loop and push the functions you want, and set them into the global space as closures.
2015-06-21 13:33:56	bone	if for some reason you want those functions to be able to work on different data simultaneously, i would recommend going the userdata route instead.
2015-06-21 13:34:18	bone	there's a C API section in "Programming in Lua" which explains all of these concepts quite thoroughly.
2015-06-21 13:35:10	ichimaru	ok I'll have a look. Thanks

2015-06-21 13:43:22	Alissa	and even then people will still prefer 5.0 for 5.1 Lua

2015-06-21 13:43:40	FatalNIX	I am using 5.1
2015-06-21 13:43:45	x10A94	What is there in 5.0 that isn't in 5.1?
2015-06-21 13:43:53	FatalNIX	I wish I could use 5.3 but I would have to write an entire new XS set for the 5.3 C API
2015-06-21 13:44:23	FatalNIX	So I got smart, made the entire Lua part of my game engine a plugin instead of a built in
2015-06-21 13:44:44	FatalNIX	and then when I'm ready to move over, itl be as easy as a plying replacement and a new set of stock /lib files.
2015-06-21 13:44:51	FatalNIX	plugin*
2015-06-21 13:45:08	FatalNIX	then some tweaks to the stuff added after stock of course.
2015-06-21 13:47:50	FatalNIX	Alissa: think I figured it out
2015-06-21 13:48:18	FatalNIX	it seems that I am not catching runtime errors, just compile errors, it seems?
2015-06-21 13:48:29	Alissa	O.o
2015-06-21 13:48:31	FatalNIX	assuming that Lua has a compile phase?
2015-06-21 13:48:31	Alissa	weird
2015-06-21 13:48:44	FatalNIX	I just tried to print a variab;le that does not exist and got no error
2015-06-21 13:48:53	furq	that doesn't raise an error
2015-06-21 13:48:54	FatalNIX	if I make any syntax errors it gives me the error.

2015-06-21 13:51:28	FatalNIX	it is in a seperate thread by newthread() just for the record
2015-06-21 13:51:31	furq	resume catches errors

2015-06-21 13:52:33	furq	yes you did
2015-06-21 13:52:44	furq	also are you writing a game engine in perl
2015-06-21 13:52:55	furq	and then adding scripting to your perl game engine in lua
2015-06-21 13:53:37	FatalNIX	sort of, but it's a plugin, it's meant to work with multiple scripting languages.
2015-06-21 13:53:48	FatalNIX	the engine does a lot of hairy stuff
2015-06-21 13:54:09	furq	would it not have been wise to pick a language for the engine which is faster than the scripting language
2015-06-21 13:54:10	FatalNIX	stuff I wouldn't want the game lib doing
2015-06-21 13:54:17	Alissa	like grow a gnarly beard, FatalNIX?
2015-06-21 13:54:21	Alissa	that'd be nice and hairy
2015-06-21 13:54:49	FatalNIX	furq: Perl is really fast, if you know what you're doing. 
2015-06-21 13:55:50	FatalNIX	it's very well optimized and I put extra effort into design optimization and immutability, and such

2015-06-21 15:31:09	FatalNIX	they're called HMDs
2015-06-21 15:31:29	cmtptr	so you see yourself in a 3d terminal surrounded by ascii?
2015-06-21 15:31:54	FatalNIX	we have a $50,000 one with two 1080p displays in it one for each eye, converged using mirrors to create a realistic 3D effect that your eyes cause from being inches apart
2015-06-21 15:31:58	FatalNIX	not exactly
2015-06-21 15:32:01	x10A94	That sounds matrix-esque

2015-06-21 15:33:03	FatalNIX	So, we're using unreal for this project, the idea is cmtptr that the unreal game will connect to my MUD engine as if it were any game server. they will be able to communicate, but on the cieling I am mounting a nice condenser microphone
2015-06-21 15:33:15	FatalNIX	and you will be able to send voice commands directly to the MUD
2015-06-21 15:33:21	FatalNIX	output gets sent as JSON or whatever to Unreal

2015-06-21 15:34:13	FatalNIX	so you can look around the room and be like, "Go down the ladder"
2015-06-21 15:34:14	cmtptr	I have a question about those things
2015-06-21 15:34:45	cmtptr	whe you have two 1080p screens just a couple of inches from your eyes
2015-06-21 15:34:56	cmtptr	doesn't it like
2015-06-21 15:34:59	cmtptr	cause a lot of strain to have to focus on that shit that close
2015-06-21 15:35:30	cmtptr	or do I just completely misunderstand how this works
2015-06-21 15:35:33	x10A94	Well 1080p is there just for clarity, you could have done this with any resolution
2015-06-21 15:35:48	x10A94	I still don't understand how you focus your eyes though
2015-06-21 15:36:08	FatalNIX	cmtptr: when you first put them on for the first time, I wouldn't say it strains your eyes but it definately shocks you when you put them on for the first time, and you get used to it very fast. the displays are behind some crazy mirrors
2015-06-21 15:36:17	FatalNIX	and the mirrors convergethe displays and also scale tyhem, focus them, etc
2015-06-21 15:36:24	FatalNIX	I havem
2015-06-21 15:37:03	FatalNIX	I haven't had any eye straining problems with them, just the problem where, when you move your head you have a 5 pound helmet that due to physics will continue to move when you stop turning your head sort of thing
2015-06-21 15:37:09	FatalNIX	if you know what I mean, and you get used to that too
2015-06-21 15:37:24	x10A94	Inertia?
2015-06-21 15:37:28	FatalNIX	yeah
2015-06-21 15:37:40	FatalNIX	you can tighten the HMD, but it doesn'
2015-06-21 15:37:52	FatalNIX	it doesn't 100% fix it
2015-06-21 15:37:56	x10A94	But then when you take it off, when your head gets used to it you turn your head so hard you break it.
2015-06-21 15:38:02	x10A94	break the neck, that is
2015-06-21 15:38:41	FatalNIX	no, it's not like that
2015-06-21 15:38:42	FatalNIX	like I said it's only like 5 pounds
2015-06-21 15:38:42	x10A94	I know, I was overexaggerating.
2015-06-21 15:38:42	FatalNIX	:)
2015-06-21 15:38:48	 *	Eyes focuses
2015-06-21 15:38:54	FatalNIX	but the accelerometer and positioning system works quite well
2015-06-21 15:39:26	FatalNIX	960FPS infared cameras track up to like 200 objects in realtime with like no latency within fractions of a milimeter in change
2015-06-21 15:39:56	x10A94	Sounds like it will cost a ton.
2015-06-21 15:40:04	FatalNIX	the camera system was $90,000
2015-06-21 15:40:27	x10A94	Well then

2015-06-21 16:13:16	_abc_	yes I wanted to know if I need to get the size and check i against sz or if I can check against nil as above. One fewer loop variable is better, no?
2015-06-21 16:13:18	Neffi	It's considering cleaner and slightly faster

2015-06-21 16:13:39	Neffi	check the length and then do it
2015-06-21 16:13:52	Neffi	also furq's ver uses locals and not globals which makes it slightly faster still

2015-06-21 16:14:55	Neffi	furq's version is faster

2015-06-21 16:18:59	_abc_	xyzzy_: it is a bad idea but the string is also trimmed from the head sometimes so its overall size does not get excessive. 
2015-06-21 16:19:16	furq	no it's a bad idea in general because lua strings are immutable
2015-06-21 16:19:27	furq	so every time you modify it you create a new string

2015-06-21 16:40:10	mniip	FatalNIX, nope, "real" "programmers" use Pascal and BASIC
2015-06-21 16:40:11	x10A94	Well, it's now luck-based.
2015-06-21 16:40:26	mniip	luck? haha
2015-06-21 16:40:28	FatalNIX	I had a pascal joke somewhere..
2015-06-21 16:40:31	furq	a plane leaves yekaterinburg at 0630, heading west, travelling at 500mph with 60 passengers on board
2015-06-21 16:40:40	furq	a) how many milligrams of alcohol were in the pilot's blood?
2015-06-21 16:40:40	x10A94	Because I am definitely sure that there are errors, it's just that whether it is hard or easy to spot
2015-06-21 16:40:43	furq	b) were there any survivors?
2015-06-21 16:40:50	x10A94	>mph
2015-06-21 16:41:00	mniip	yeah real units please
2015-06-21 16:41:14	FatalNIX	furq: where did they bury the survivors?
2015-06-21 16:41:16	furq	i like how you complain about the units and not about me assuming that everyone on the russian domestic flight would die

2015-06-21 16:42:11	FatalNIX	mniip: HOW
2015-06-21 16:42:24	mniip	FatalNIX, they couldn't land dude to fog
2015-06-21 16:42:32	FatalNIX	where was this?
2015-06-21 16:42:33	mniip	after a few hours they decided to land in a nearby city
2015-06-21 16:42:39	mniip	then they ordered a bus
2015-06-21 16:42:47	mniip	which took a shitton of time to get there (because russia)
2015-06-21 16:42:49	FatalNIX	mniip: because in the US thats exactly why we have something called ILS
2015-06-21 16:42:57	mniip	and then guess what
2015-06-21 16:42:57	FatalNIX	oh I see it wasnt us
2015-06-21 16:42:58	furq	christ
2015-06-21 16:42:59	furq	a russian bus
2015-06-21 16:43:00	mniip	the bus broke down
2015-06-21 16:43:10	furq	i bet russian buses are like castles of joy
2015-06-21 16:43:12	x10A94	That is basically the essence of Russia
2015-06-21 16:43:24	FatalNIX	I see now. mniip here in the US we have ILS, which can land the plane in thick fog using autopilot
2015-06-21 16:43:31	furq	buses are already shit in proper countries
2015-06-21 16:43:33	FatalNIX	it's pretty neat stuff
2015-06-21 16:43:36	FatalNIX	much more accurate than GPS
2015-06-21 16:43:53	furq	you mean GLONASS
2015-06-21 16:43:55	mniip	what's an ILS
2015-06-21 16:44:09	furq	it's a neurodegenerative disease

2015-06-21 16:48:24	FatalNIX	and autopilot can just home in when theres like no visibility whatsoever

2015-06-21 17:32:29	FatalNIX	Alissa: could mean moe than one thing, but the method modifiers I'm talking about are generally associated with meta programming. for example. let's say I had a function called "foo"
2015-06-21 17:32:46	FatalNIX	and then I include a mixin that says: after "foo" run this function()
2015-06-21 17:33:09	FatalNIX	or before foo() or if you want to go deep, you could even do wrappers with around foo()
2015-06-21 17:33:27	FatalNIX	the argument to that function are typically passed to the method modifier function
2015-06-21 17:33:41	Alissa	alright, makes sense.
2015-06-21 17:33:51	 *	Alissa is programming debug.sethook stuff in head.
2015-06-21 17:34:18	FatalNIX	yeah, they're ueful for many different things.. one example is to have a class full of mixins, and have each mixin hook onto some callback without registering anything
2015-06-21 17:34:21	Alissa	before you can probably use a call hook; after, a return hook.
2015-06-21 17:34:51	Alissa	don't know enough about the debug library myself to help with it too much though

2015-06-21 17:36:12	FatalNIX	I needed to hook onto an action population event
2015-06-21 17:36:34	FatalNIX	by using a modifier, you don't overload the function.

2015-06-21 17:57:15	furq	the worst is when it starts playing 10 seconds after the page has loaded because you're skipping the ad

2015-06-21 17:58:01	furq	i should really turn flashblock back on
2015-06-21 17:58:04	xyzzy_	yes
2015-06-21 17:58:07	Alissa	i print before coroutine.yield(), i print as an argument to coroutine.yield(), i print after coroutine.yield()

2015-06-21 17:58:29	furq	what do you expect a print after yield to do

2015-06-21 17:59:59	furq	i forget why i got rid of flashblock now
2015-06-21 18:00:06	furq	oh wait
2015-06-21 18:00:19	furq	it was because all of the flash videos on bbc.co.uk have been broken for months and i thought it might have been flashblock
2015-06-21 18:00:29	furq	i still haven't figured out why that's happening ;_;
2015-06-21 18:00:40	Zarutian	furq: heck if this was aviable option in adblock I would checkmark that: aggressive botnet hiring that takes out the adservers that are specified.

2015-06-22 12:47:55	xyzzy_	>Super Go Karts: The karts were meant to be driven around a small loop track at a speed of about 20 mph (32 km/h) set by the governor devices on them. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for parkgoers. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine car ride became a chance to play bumper cars at 50 mph (80 km/h), and many injuries resulted from head-on

2015-06-23 00:26:14	furq	youtube's suggestions get worse by the day
2015-06-23 00:26:32	Spacemonkey	furq, I was doing some research yesterday you would enjoy.
2015-06-23 00:27:07	furq	would i
2015-06-23 00:27:09	Spacemonkey	The number of annual elevator deaths will impress you, not by their volume, but by their nature.
2015-06-23 00:28:02	furq	are you sure you want to use a word as strong as "impress"
2015-06-23 00:28:18	Spacemonkey	furq, yeah, im pretty confident.
2015-06-23 00:28:26	furq	go on then
2015-06-23 00:28:29	Spacemonkey	Why would I waste your time.
2015-06-23 00:28:46	furq	that's a question only you can answer
2015-06-23 00:29:01	Spacemonkey	Ok well only around 30 people die each year in elevators
2015-06-23 00:29:17	Spacemonkey	but those who do die, it is usually of decapatation.
2015-06-23 00:29:30	Spacemonkey	or generally getting chopped in half.
2015-06-23 00:29:47	Spacemonkey	occasionally someone falls down an elevator shaft.
2015-06-23 00:29:49	furq	is that from trying to crawl out of a lift which has stopped halfway between floors
2015-06-23 00:30:06	Spacemonkey	sometimes, or if the door sensors are screwed.
2015-06-23 00:30:12	furq	also notice how i said "lift" because i'm not some kind of shitty american
2015-06-23 00:30:23	furq	i don't call myself tex and drive a truck called convoy
2015-06-23 00:30:25	Spacemonkey	In several cases the service engineers miswire the sensors during testing etc.
2015-06-23 00:30:38	furq	i would never use a collective noun for a single vehicle
2015-06-23 00:30:43	Spacemonkey	So the elevator does not realise someone is still trying to get in.
2015-06-23 00:30:56	Spacemonkey	Here is the real good bit:
2015-06-23 00:31:01	furq	this isn't impressing me so much as making me terrified of lifts
2015-06-23 00:31:51	Spacemonkey	In the decapitations, usually the head ends up in the lift and the body falls down the shaft. So the other terrified passengers get to enjoy that. Also as they have usually hit the stop button they get to enjoy it for tens of minutes/hours.
2015-06-23 00:32:23	furq	yeah but they still have their heads
2015-06-23 00:32:32	furq	it's a small price to pay for a functioning body that works properly
2015-06-23 00:32:39	Spacemonkey	and the image of the severed head burnt into their retina
2015-06-23 00:33:23	Spacemonkey	I am glad to share that bit of research with someone. Thanks.
2015-06-23 00:33:37	furq	i have some interesting research to share too
2015-06-23 00:33:46	furq	do you know which tetris piece is most likely to spawn
2015-06-23 00:33:55	Spacemonkey	square?
2015-06-23 00:33:57	furq	no
2015-06-23 00:34:02	Spacemonkey	L ?
2015-06-23 00:34:03	furq	it's none of them
2015-06-23 00:34:09	Spacemonkey	all equal?
2015-06-23 00:34:11	furq	yes
2015-06-23 00:34:16	Spacemonkey	fascinating
2015-06-23 00:34:22	furq	it's good isn't it
2015-06-23 00:34:37	Spacemonkey	yes, very impressive

2015-06-23 00:35:11	Neffiphone	I question whether you applied due diligence
2015-06-23 00:35:44	furq	do you really want me to tell you everything i know about tetris randomisers
2015-06-23 00:36:04	Neffiphone	sure why not
2015-06-23 00:36:22	furq	which officially licensed tetris game would you like me to start with
2015-06-23 00:36:46	Neffiphone	there's more than one?
2015-06-23 00:36:48	furq	obviously i don't include those shitty tetris games which always spawn z pieces which are called "LOLTRIS" and "NOPTRIS"
2015-06-23 00:37:05	Neffiphone	but those are the best
2015-06-23 00:37:08	furq	and yes
2015-06-23 00:38:00	furq	there's nes tetris, gameboy tetris, sega tetris, super tetris, tetris plus, tetris the grand master, tetris ds
2015-06-23 00:38:03	furq	and many more

2015-06-23 00:39:00	Neffiphone	OK let's start there
2015-06-23 00:39:41	furq	ok
2015-06-23 00:39:48	furq	TGM uses a 14-bag randomiser
2015-06-23 00:39:55	furq	the first piece of the game may never be an O, S or Z block
2015-06-23 00:40:14	furq	after that, pieces are drawn from the bag until it is empty, then the bag is refilled with 14 more blocks, two of each type
2015-06-23 00:40:34	furq	if the same piece is drawn twice in succession it is redrawn up to three times, then if it's still the same, it's used
2015-06-23 00:40:46	furq	so it's possible to have the same piece four times in a row, but it's incredibly unlikely
2015-06-23 00:41:48	furq	to be honest there isn't really much more to say about the randomiser
2015-06-23 00:41:49	Neffiphone	why didn't they just randomize it each time?
2015-06-23 00:41:55	furq	randomise what each time
2015-06-23 00:42:07	Spacemonkey	the player
2015-06-23 00:42:08	furq	just pick pieces at random instead of using a bag?
2015-06-23 00:42:23	furq	that's how nes and gameboy tetris do it, and you end up with fucked piece distributions
2015-06-23 00:42:33	furq	and runs of 5 Z blocks

2015-06-23 02:15:51	Spacemonkey	I used to have NTL back in the day when I lieved elsewhere and it was great, better than any ADSL 
2015-06-23 02:16:18	Spacemonkey	mark_otaris, dunno £20 per month plus line rental, probably works out around £50 pcm
2015-06-23 02:16:27	furq	??
2015-06-23 02:16:34	furq	isn't BT line rental like 13.50
2015-06-23 02:16:35	Spacemonkey	Pluswank + BT
2015-06-23 02:16:50	mark_otaris	oh well I get 50 MiB/s for that much
2015-06-23 02:16:56	furq	the other nice thing about VM is that you don't have to pay line rental
2015-06-23 02:17:08	furq	so you don't get obvious bullshit prices
2015-06-23 02:17:14	Spacemonkey	If they are anything like their NTL days they are hard to quit though
2015-06-23 02:17:47	furq	talktalk keep sending me letters which say "FREE BROADBAND FOR 12 MONTHS!!! plus £20 line rental lol"
2015-06-23 02:18:10	Spacemonkey	£4000 early cancellation fee when you discover they are only giving you dial-up speeds

2015-06-23 02:18:52	Neffi	They don't cut off my internet. They throttle it. And it's a private agreement between businesses, not a court mandate.

2015-06-23 02:19:25	Spacemonkey	furq, I only have to ask parents, inlaws, or anyone of a certain generation who buys their internet with zero research.

2015-06-23 02:20:05	furq	he posted a graph from that thinkbroadband ping service and it was just a big red block of packet loss

2015-06-23 02:27:08	furq	you could probably get the same service and just pay for line rental
2015-06-23 02:27:11	Spacemonkey	I am going to cancel BT anyways, because we have free calls on the mobiles and my wife occasionally foregtsa and I have to pay £25 for calls that should be free.

2015-06-23 19:44:59	paulk2	I think you will only need to include ....\msys64\mingw32\bin\ in your PATH

2015-06-25 23:41:34	bone	if apple actually pulled that, you can just go to the EFF, and you'd get on plenty of news sites... no problemo.

2015-06-25 23:43:45	bone	then you can go on fox news and talk about how you were just protecting your first and second amendment rights as a brit.
2015-06-25 23:43:53	ttmrichter	I'm recommending this for the nation that has more handguns than people.

2015-06-26 21:56:59	Taoki	Hi everyone. I have another logical proble with my code, and would really appreciate an idea with it. I need to go now, but will stay on the channel and read any response tomorrow (highlight me please)
2015-06-26 21:56:59	Taoki	I have a table containing any number of tables. Each nested table represents a 2D rectangle. The structure is something like: rectangles = {{start_x = #, end_x = #, start_z = #, end_z = #}, {...}, ...}.
2015-06-26 21:56:59	Taoki	Each rectangle has a pre-defined but individual size. I want the position of each rectangle to be random. However, I won't want any two rectangles to intersect each other. What is the easiest way to get random but non-intersecting start positions?
2015-06-26 21:57:55	Taoki	Basically, for each rectangle, start_x and start_z will be math.random(something). end_x and end_z will be start_x + size and start_z + size. The random start_* are the problem
2015-06-26 21:58:23	Taoki	Obviously, the random value must range between a minimum and a maximum (integer). Can be anything... like 20 to 150, 1000 to 1346, etc.

2015-06-26 21:59:45	bone	store the coordinates in a table as keys perhaps, so you can handily look them up to look for whatever it is that you don't want.
2015-06-26 21:59:47	Taoki	Currently I use a normal, uncontrolled math.random(start, end). But obviously that doesn't guard against intersections. I need an easy and efficient way to do that, without an expensive check or running into an infinite loop by trying the positions over and over again
2015-06-26 22:00:20	Taoki	bone: I can use a loop and check the stored positions, but not sure what the most efficient way is
2015-06-26 22:00:51	Taoki	I was hoping I could use some trickery in math.random to include acceptable ranges, or a simple pattern in a single loop
2015-06-26 22:02:55	bone	you can tell it a range.
2015-06-26 22:02:58	bone	math.random that is.
2015-06-26 22:03:40	Taoki	Yeah, but can't check for 2D intersections in one go... can I?
2015-06-26 22:03:48	Taoki	Hmmm... maybe with two nested loops?
2015-06-26 22:04:03	Taoki	Which can limit between a series of ranges each
2015-06-26 22:06:43	bone	maybe two tables, one for x and one for z, then iterate and look for overlaps.
2015-06-26 22:07:38	Taoki	Yeah. Question is how is simplest and best.
2015-06-26 22:07:52	Taoki	Need to go now. Staying on the channel though, will return tomorrow

2015-06-28 17:23:53	icelesstea	hdon: It should do that only on the first line.
2015-06-28 17:24:03	furq	no it shouldn't
2015-06-28 17:24:20	furq	it should do that if the first two bytes are #!
2015-06-28 17:24:30	icelesstea	That is more accurate.
2015-06-28 17:25:01	furq	i'm using vim and i'm pretty sure i didn't have to install a separate lua highlighter
2015-06-28 17:25:40	Soni	what does - do in patterns?

2015-06-28 17:26:47	Soni	I know - is the opposite of +
2015-06-28 17:26:49	furq	are you sure filetype is set correctly
2015-06-28 17:26:57	Soni	so is it 1 or more, nongreedy?
2015-06-28 17:27:10	Soni	or is it 0 or more, nongreedy?
2015-06-28 17:27:13	icelesstea	hdon: Don't take my word for any of that though, I don't use any syntax highlighting so I don't actually know how the "default" highlighting stuff looks like.
2015-06-28 17:27:25	hdon	furq: i haven't checked
2015-06-28 17:27:30	hdon	icelesstea: ah, heh
2015-06-28 17:27:39	furq	you don't use highlighting?

2015-06-28 17:36:57	q66	ah yes i remember what i meant to call it now
2015-06-28 17:37:01	q66	that font is way too small
2015-06-28 17:37:06	furq	that's correct

2015-06-28 17:37:39	furq	i said it's just right

2015-06-28 17:37:43	q66	it's small
2015-06-28 17:37:55	furq	we had a moment of such harmony there
2015-06-28 17:37:59	furq	when we both agreed that the other font was too small
2015-06-28 17:38:02	furq	why are you ruining it
2015-06-28 17:38:07	furq	with your big font lies
2015-06-28 17:38:10	q66	because yours is too small too
2015-06-28 17:38:41	hdon	furq: i do like the look of that font more, but i can't get gvim to not do subpixel hinting and other bs
2015-06-28 17:39:05	hdon	which is even worse at work where i turn my display 90 degrees and it doesn't seem to understand that the pixel geometry has changed
2015-06-28 17:39:18	furq	just use a bitmap font
2015-06-28 17:39:25	furq	and hope that no unicode happens

2015-06-28 17:47:24	furq	and your hostname is "butts" when it should be the name of a boss from a 1998 arcade game

2015-06-28 17:59:06	q66	i'd advise you not to either
2015-06-28 17:59:11	hdon	mmm
2015-06-28 17:59:13	furq	why not
2015-06-28 17:59:19	q66	i had some and they all died
2015-06-28 17:59:31	hdon	:(
2015-06-28 17:59:42	furq	yeah but you can get anecdotal evidence of that about any hardware manufacturer
2015-06-28 17:59:48	furq	i've owned six WD disks and they're all dead now
2015-06-28 17:59:55	q66	yeah but this was like 4 cards and they all died
2015-06-28 18:00:03	furq	and two sapphire cards and they both died
2015-06-28 18:00:07	q66	like a year after
2015-06-28 18:00:10	hdon	my machine reboots instantly if the gpu temperature reaches a certain level (can't remember what it was though, hasn't happened in a year; stopped pushing it)
2015-06-28 18:00:30	q66	gigabyte is shit just like gainward is shit
2015-06-28 18:00:32	hdon	it seems like an extreme reaction, though *maybe* a better one than melting or catching fire
2015-06-28 18:00:45	q66	hdon, it's an appropriate reaction
2015-06-28 18:00:54	q66	it means that the hw failsafe mechanisms work
2015-06-28 18:00:57	hdon	well what i don't understand is that my CPU just slows down if it's too hot
2015-06-28 18:01:15	q66	throttling
2015-06-28 18:01:20	q66	standard stuff
2015-06-28 18:01:25	hdon	yeah well
2015-06-28 18:01:27	furq	he's asking why his gpu doesn't throttle
2015-06-28 18:01:28	hdon	why not the GPU then?
2015-06-28 18:01:44	q66	maybe it does and it's still not enough
2015-06-28 18:01:45	furq	given that it obviously can downclock itself because you can do it on the fly
2015-06-28 18:01:48	xxleite	driving good furq http://bit.ly/1edkJeL
2015-06-28 18:01:51	hdon	hmm, could be
2015-06-28 18:02:08	furq	lol formula e
2015-06-28 18:02:09	q66	i mean, for example my card keeps itself underclocked pretty much all the time unless performance is requested
2015-06-28 18:02:18	furq	have you seen any formula e races
2015-06-28 18:02:29	furq	they have a pitstop where the driver gets out of the car and gets into another car
2015-06-28 18:02:29	xxleite	no
2015-06-28 18:02:34	furq	because the battery packs can only run for half the race
2015-06-28 18:02:37	hdon	i would like to request performance. dance, gpu. dance.
2015-06-28 18:02:44	furq	that's a great advertisement for electric cars right there
2015-06-28 18:02:46	xxleite	seems logical
2015-06-28 18:03:03	q66	hdon, anyway, get something from evga
2015-06-28 18:03:09	q66	perhaps msi
2015-06-28 18:03:17	xxleite	Elon Musk must be watching
2015-06-28 18:03:18	q66	maybe palit/pny
2015-06-28 18:03:20	furq	i always rated msi as even shonkier than gigabyte
2015-06-28 18:03:29	q66	they're ok
2015-06-28 18:03:29	hdon	$330 not bad
2015-06-28 18:03:32	q66	but evga is better
2015-06-28 18:03:34	hdon	from evga
2015-06-28 18:03:45	furq	evga are good but you'll pay for it

2015-06-28 18:04:03	q66	so i went for a Palit model with different port setup
2015-06-28 18:04:07	furq	and usually if it's a reference cooler then it's exactly the same card
2015-06-28 18:04:13	Neffi	They're all the same cards. You're paying for warranty and support, and MSI is fine. 
2015-06-28 18:04:29	furq	Neffi: the coolers are different and that is important
2015-06-28 18:04:39	q66	the pcb is often different too
2015-06-28 18:04:39	furq	speaking as someone who's had several failed cards due to shit manufacturer cooling
2015-06-28 18:04:40	Neffi	If you want a non-reference, go Asus. They've been better for the last several generations. 
2015-06-28 18:04:43	furq	even with the stock hsf
2015-06-28 18:05:05	furq	i've had cards where the manufacturer has replaced a heatsink with a bit of thermal tape which has ripped in half
2015-06-28 18:05:07	Neffi	EVGA had two generations in a row where their cooler's sink plate didn't even line up to the GPU and they just shrugged it off and shipped it anyway.

2015-06-28 18:06:53	q66	and gainward
2015-06-28 18:06:55	EatThePath	oddball throwback question time: Is anyone aware of tools/libraries/whatnot existing to translate or automaticly convert from lua 4 code to lua 5?
2015-06-28 18:06:57	Neffi	If coolers and non-reference design is your priority, Asus, has them beat for a while now. If support and warranty is your focus, I hear Asus is just as good or better. EVGA IMO has grown irrelevant. 
2015-06-28 18:07:10	Neffi	Their last several non-reference cards could not OC signficiantly better than reference 
2015-06-28 18:07:13	hdon	i love the ad copy the graphics card manufacturers get in the press kit for the gpus they buy
2015-06-28 18:07:14	q66	Neffi, asus is not really that great
2015-06-28 18:07:17	q66	it's ok
2015-06-28 18:07:22	q66	but for example palit jetstream > asus strix
2015-06-28 18:07:24	hdon	things like "Dynamic Super Resolution Technology"
2015-06-28 18:07:34	furq	i had an 8800GT a while back from "CLUB 3D" which it turns out they'd put the cooler from an 8600GT on
2015-06-28 18:07:41	furq	i don't understand how that's a profitable thing to do, but there you go
2015-06-28 18:07:50	furq	so obviously the card ran hot as shit
2015-06-28 18:07:57	furq	and eventually the memory fucked up
2015-06-28 18:08:02	q66	haha
2015-06-28 18:08:04	Neffi	q66: IMO top cooling performance isn't the ideal. Being able to dissipate enough heat for a respectable overclock while being quiet is the ideal. 
2015-06-28 18:08:17	furq	but yeah stuff like that is not at all restricted to cheapo cards
2015-06-28 18:08:23	furq	the thing with the thermal tape was on a sapphire card
2015-06-28 18:08:29	q66	yes, what i said beats the strix in being quiet and in overclockability
2015-06-28 18:08:37	q66	but overclocking sucks and you should never do it
2015-06-28 18:08:57	Neffi	q66: Good to hear! It's always good to have choice 
2015-06-28 18:09:04	Neffi	Why does overclocking suck? 
2015-06-28 18:09:10	q66	useless
2015-06-28 18:09:15	darkstalker	one of my vga's died because of cooling problems, so from now on i only buy things with oversized heatpipe fans
2015-06-28 18:09:17	Neffi	You flip a switch and your GPU is hitting its potential 
2015-06-28 18:09:31	q66	by the time you need to overclock your hw is typically way obsolete anyway
2015-06-28 18:09:34	Neffi	It's not uncommon to get 20-30% extra performance for free. That's nothing to scoff at. 
2015-06-28 18:09:37	hdon	this seems to just be resampling
2015-06-28 18:09:41	Neffi	"need to"? 
2015-06-28 18:09:52	q66	it also reduces the lifespan of your hardware
2015-06-28 18:10:00	Neffi	Not signficantly 
2015-06-28 18:10:10	Neffi	Not enough to matter. It'll still outlast its usefulness. 
2015-06-28 18:10:20	Neffi	Several times over at that
2015-06-28 18:10:28	q66	and it makes it hit higher temperatures == make more noise
2015-06-28 18:10:43	EatThePath	Guess not. It was a longshot anyway.
2015-06-28 18:10:50	Neffi	If the cooler can sustain the heat load without being too noisy, and your case's airflow can manage the same, then that's not an issue
2015-06-28 18:11:20	Neffi	And OCing itself is literally as easy to changing a slider now, at least for GPUs. It's pretty much 100% safe. There's no reason not to overclock. 
2015-06-28 18:12:29	_Getty	is the luaj environment one of the more supreme embedded lua environment or is it more like at the lower end and most others are at this level and better?

2015-06-28 18:15:39	Neffi	Reference Lua is trivial to embed too. And there are other implementations. What you really need to ask yourself is, do you want a Lua host written in C/C++, or one in Java? Or something else? 
2015-06-28 18:16:44	Neffi	I'm not familiar with what all games use, but reference Lua seems to be the most popular from what I see 
2015-06-28 18:17:08	Neffi	It's very fast, very light, easy to embed, and fully compliant with the spec, so no worries about your implementation diverging in areas that might confuse your users

2015-06-28 18:24:04	Neffi	_Getty: You should strive to write code according to the Lua manual, because that is the specification of the language, and the code will work on any compliant implementation of Lua as well. If you code against the manual, and your code fails in some implementation, then either you made a mistake or that implementation does not implement Lua correctly.

2015-06-28 18:28:17	_Getty	well most lua environments are propably not made to be specific for Lua only ;) like LuaJIT is, so i am mostly talking about those where they specific pick lua for the "batteries not included" part
2015-06-28 18:28:49	_Getty	so game development or embedded scripting in custom environment in general, i mean thats Luas main sale point ;)
2015-06-28 18:29:46	_Getty	or am i really an alien here with using Lua just in those cases? ;-)
2015-06-28 18:30:47	_Getty	i already see that it is very hard to find PureLua modules, given the situation that nearly all those custom-batteries cases needs specific those, but its so hard to find them gathered, or i miss a good archive ;)
2015-06-28 18:30:48	EatThePath	I doubt it, but I don't see why a Lua implementation in that context would be assumed to be incomplete or flawed somehow

2015-06-28 18:31:36	Neffi	Well, I'm sure many are. There are lots of little niche implementations, including ones created inside game scripting layers and such (see: Minecraft, Skyrim) 
2015-06-28 18:31:44	darkstalker	penlight is a pure lua library with tons of "battery" stuff

2015-06-28 18:33:04	_Getty	neffi: but me as user of the lua environment, i wouldnt know how i could add those
2015-06-28 18:33:20	_Getty	Neffi: i am open for info there, i would love to have luarocks then it would all be much easier, but i dont have it
2015-06-28 18:33:28	Neffi	It looks as though it's an entirely custom implementation that lacks the reference C API, so naturally most Lua modules will not work. 
2015-06-28 18:33:42	_Getty	yes i know

2015-06-28 18:33:52	darkstalker	you should give more context, like showing the code of your game engine
2015-06-28 18:33:52	furq	most of penlight should work
2015-06-28 18:33:56	Neffi	Well, most of the useful modules are written in C
2015-06-28 18:33:59	furq	the filesystem stuff won't work because it depends on lfs

2015-06-28 18:50:42	worstje	Suppose some code running inside Environment#1 does: ""tbl["myfunc"] = function () return string.len("aa") end"" ... If at a later point code from Environment#2, which is unrelated to Env#1 save for having access to tbl, then calls tbl.myfunc(), where does myfunc get the 'string' table from? From Env#1 or Env#2?
2015-06-28 18:50:57	EatThePath	I'm trying to write a tool to edit some data files for an old data driven game engine. The tool is being written in Unity, because it's what I know, and the game's data files are lua scripts. So I figure the most durable and accurate way to do things would be to actually embed lua in the tool and just execute the files. The trouble is that the game is from 2003.

2015-06-28 18:52:02	furq	if string is localised and tbl.myfunc closes over it, then #1
2015-06-28 18:53:23	EatThePath	Scouring for existing solutions is proving, not unexpectedly, to be a dry well since there wasn't a great deal of overlap between C#/mono usage and Lua 4.0, and embedding it myself is proving somewhat beyond my limited experince.
2015-06-28 18:57:01	furq	EatThePath: lua 5.0 ships with a compat.lua which is supposed to ease the transition
2015-06-28 18:57:09	furq	i have no idea how effective it is, i've never used 4.0 (or 5.0)

2015-06-28 21:15:44	furq	what was your favourite part
2015-06-28 21:15:47	furq	was it the operation
2015-06-28 21:15:52	furq	was it the flash
2015-06-28 21:15:54	furq	or was it the point
2015-06-28 21:16:02	Soni	yes and utf8 isn't allowed to encode invalid codepoints
2015-06-28 21:16:19	Soni	otherwise it stops being utf8
2015-06-28 21:17:06	cmtptr	no it was the part where I tried to step over a chair and clipped through a wall on the second story of a house and fell outside and broke my legs and then had to crawl around at an excruciatingly slow speed before the retarded ai found me and shot me
2015-06-28 21:17:33	furq	sounds like you needed an...operation
2015-06-28 21:17:35	cmtptr	it's a game about realism, you see

2015-06-28 21:18:19	furq	i don't know what you're talking about
2015-06-28 21:19:41	cmtptr	it takes place smack dab in the middle of the 80s
2015-06-28 21:19:46	cmtptr	the best part of the 80s
2015-06-28 21:20:14	furq	what, 1986?

2015-06-28 21:23:40	daurnimator	Soni: "Whether an actual application should do this is debatable".... sounds like something a programming language probably shouldn't enforce then.
2015-06-28 21:24:08	daurnimator	especially one like lua that is about "mechanism, not policy"
2015-06-28 21:24:16	Soni	uhh ok

2015-06-28 21:26:19	furq	but 1986 is the best part of the 80s
2015-06-28 21:27:11	Soni	daurnimator, thanks
2015-06-28 21:29:39	daurnimator	Soni: ?
2015-06-28 21:30:03	Soni	wait what if the value can be encoded in UTF8 but isn't a valid codepoint at all? (past 0x10FFFF upto 0x7FFFFFFF)
2015-06-28 21:30:22	daurnimator	Soni: it can't though..
2015-06-28 21:30:34	daurnimator	Soni: utf8 now has a max of 4 bytes
2015-06-28 21:31:02	Soni	but the utf8 encoding supports up to 6
2015-06-28 21:31:20	daurnimator	Soni: no it doesn't
2015-06-28 21:31:24	daurnimator	Soni: it hasn't since the 90s
2015-06-28 21:31:32	Soni	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description
2015-06-28 21:31:38	Soni	the encoding format supports up to 6

2015-06-28 21:32:13	daurnimator	Soni: read what you just linked... I'll wait
2015-06-28 21:32:29	Soni	it says the encoding format can go up to 31 bits 
2015-06-28 21:32:36	daurnimator	"The design of UTF-8 can be seen in this table of the scheme as originally proposed by Dave Prosser and subsequently modified by Ken Thompson (the x characters are replaced by the bits of the code point):" <== i.e. that was the original proposal
2015-06-28 21:32:42	daurnimator	"The original specification covered numbers up to 31 bits (the original limit of the Universal Character Set). In November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by RFC 3629 to end at U+10FFFF, in order to match the constraints of the UTF-16 character encoding. This removed all 5- and 6-byte sequences, and about half of the 4-byte sequences."
2015-06-28 21:32:54	daurnimator	^^ oh hey, I was wrong. it wasn't the 90s, it was 2003
2015-06-28 21:33:14	Soni	ok what about the other half of the 4-byte sequences?
2015-06-28 21:34:20	daurnimator	"In November 2003, UTF-8 was restricted by RFC 3629 to end at U+10FFFF" <== that's it. that's the point. since 2003, utf8 no longer defines how to encode things >0x10FFFF
2015-06-28 21:35:07	Soni	meh nvm
2015-06-28 21:35:18	Soni	(the _format_ can encode it, btw)
2015-06-28 21:35:55	daurnimator	Soni: if you use an old version of utf8... sure. or you could define your own extension that allows it again. but utf8, as defined in RFC3629, does not.
2015-06-28 21:36:51	daurnimator	and that is what lua 5.3's utf8 library choose to follow: the encoding of utf8, as defined in that RFC. not other semantics of unicode; just the utf8 encoding.
2015-06-28 21:37:23	Soni	I'm sure it'll happily take overlong encodings and things like that
2015-06-28 21:37:47	Soni	(didn't test but w/e)
2015-06-28 21:38:32	daurnimator	Soni: the manual sort of cops out on that one with the magical phrase "assuming that the subject is a valid UTF-8 string."

2015-06-29 00:05:59	furq	my favourite bit of arnie trivia is that he wanted to do his own voice in the german dub of terminator 2
2015-06-29 00:06:07	furq	but they wouldn't let him because he's austrian and he sounds like a farmer

When Thorp wrote the sequel, the studio was contractually obliged to offer Sinatra the lead role despite his being 73 years old at the time. Sinatra turned down the role. The story was then changed to have no connection to The Detective and instead pursued as a sequel to the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring action f
2015-06-29 00:14:49	furq	ilm Commando, but Schwarzenegger was not interested in reprising his role. The script was offered to a variety of action stars including Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford, and Don Johnson, all of whom turned it down.

2015-06-29 01:31:39	Dyla	for example,http://codepad.org/dYeTFkv9,on my interpreter the output would be newyork
2015-06-29 01:31:57	_Getty	Neffi: seriously, why you dont start with explaining that there are different lua implementations and not all are the same?
2015-06-29 01:31:58	furq	because the repl doesn't persist locals across lines

2015-06-29 01:33:09	Dyla	Yeah...
2015-06-29 01:33:12	Neffi	Each line of the REPL is a separate scope 
2015-06-29 01:33:17	Neffi	Rather, a separate block
2015-06-29 01:33:29	Neffi	err.. chunk. there we go
2015-06-29 01:33:36	Neffi	So locals do not persist
2015-06-29 01:33:37	furq	or MAYBE he's running it in an implementation which doesn't have locals?? how do you know
2015-06-29 01:33:46	furq	you're so ignorant
2015-06-29 01:33:47	_Getty	furq: well noone asked him, which was my critic

2015-06-29 01:34:10	Dyla	yeah..but why the output different when I type the code on interactive mode?
2015-06-29 01:34:24	furq	05:31:59 ( furq) because the repl doesn't persist locals across lines
2015-06-29 01:34:30	Neffi	Dyla: Because the last line doesn't "see" the local on line 2

2015-06-29 01:34:32	furq	05:33:13 ( Neffi) Each line of the REPL is a separate [chunk]
2015-06-29 01:34:38	furq	do you like my editing
2015-06-29 01:34:48	Neffi	it's beautiful 
2015-06-29 01:35:17	furq	Dyla: you can wrap it in a do...end block if you want locals to work
2015-06-29 01:35:20	furq	or put it all on one line
2015-06-29 01:35:37	Neffi	Dyla: Typing into the REPL is not like writing a file. Each line you type in is run as if it were a separate file, so locals are limited to that line. 
2015-06-29 01:35:53	Dyla	okay..thanks,I understand.
2015-06-29 01:35:53	furq	but the only way to get the output of a chunk is to compile it and run it, and you can't add to it once you've done that

2015-06-29 01:37:22	Dyla	yeah,the local scope has ended when I state it,thats why the print function print the global one

2015-06-29 19:52:17	Neffi	azrael_: I don't believe it's even valid. What code are you converting? 
2015-06-29 19:52:22	J_Darnley	azrael_: are you asking what the require function does?
2015-06-29 19:52:44	Neffi	require expands . to /
2015-06-29 19:52:46	azrael_	Neffi: Here is the code https://github.com/Azrael1/treelstm/blob/master/relatedness/main.lua
2015-06-29 19:52:48	Neffi	as you can see in my error message
2015-06-29 19:53:08	azrael_	Yes I tried that out by myself and got the same error message
2015-06-29 19:53:29	azrael_	J_Darnley: I understand that require imports modules
2015-06-29 19:53:43	Neffi	hehe
2015-06-29 19:53:56	azrael_	Could ('..') mean to import all the lua files in the directory?
2015-06-29 19:53:56	Neffi	it requires <workingdirectory>/init.lua
2015-06-29 19:54:01	J_Darnley	okay, I didn't know whether '..' was supposed to be a real module
2015-06-29 19:54:02	Neffi	no it could not
2015-06-29 19:54:08	Neffi	but it could mean init.lua from the current directly 
2015-06-29 19:54:17	Neffi	or ".lua" or ".so"
2015-06-29 19:54:23	cmtptr	why not ('.') then?
2015-06-29 19:54:38	Neffi	why not anything else that makes any sense? 
2015-06-29 19:54:48	cmtptr	why not ("")
2015-06-29 19:54:49	Neffi	I'm not saying what they're doing isn't totally stupid

2015-06-29 19:55:19	Neffi	azrael_: If you see the error message, it gives you a rundown of files it's trying to load 
2015-06-29 19:55:41	Neffi	If init.lua exists in the present working directory, it will attempt to load that. There are others it will attempt as well. See the error message. 
2015-06-29 19:55:53	Neffi	this depends on package.path and package.cpath
2015-06-29 19:56:12	Neffi	there may also be a custom loader/preload/searcher in their environment
2015-06-29 19:56:30	Neffi	It's certainly not idiomatic Lua

2015-06-29 19:57:45	azrael_	Only these three files are there
2015-06-29 19:57:54	azrael_	1) LSTMSim.lua
2015-06-29 19:57:55	Neffi	azrael_: Open a ticket or something and ask them wtf is up 
2015-06-29 19:58:17	Neffi	Looking at the project itself, this call to require should fail. So something else is going on that they are not disclosing. 
2015-06-29 19:59:17	azrael_	Ok there is a init.lua outside the directory
2015-06-29 19:59:48	azrael_	So can the lua file access stuff outside the directory if it does not find inside it?
2015-06-29 20:00:01	Neffi	If that's the working directory 
2015-06-29 20:00:15	Neffi	require() searches the working directory, not the directory where the script resides 
2015-06-29 20:01:07	azrael_	The working directory means the directory from where the main function is called to execute the whole code right?
2015-06-29 20:01:21	Neffi	not necessarily, no 
2015-06-29 20:01:29	azrael_	So?
2015-06-29 20:02:06	Neffi	Working directory as in, your shell
