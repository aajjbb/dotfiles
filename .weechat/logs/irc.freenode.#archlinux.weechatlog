2014-12-11 17:04:59	zagabar	Hello. I wanted to enable multilib but instead of only uncommenting the [multilib] section i also uncommented the [multilib-testing] section, and then ran pacman -Syu. I then realised the mistake, cancelled and commented out [multilib-testing] but leaving [multilib] still on, and rthen ran pacman -Syu fine. However, now when I try to install steam from AUR which needs some 32 lib stuff, I am getting errors
2014-12-11 17:05:02	zagabar	like: "target not found: lib32-libindicator" and google tells me that I need to enable multilib, which I already have, so is it possible that my brief uncommenting of multilib-testing broke something?

2014-12-11 22:02:04	halosghost	Earnestly: one of my favorite examples: snprintf() takes a size_t for number of bytes to write but returns an int for number of bytes written

2014-12-11 22:02:14	Earnestly	It's actually pretty hard, so while those books are good at describing the language, you just have to be mindful

Doing that is a bad hack anyway: if it works it means that something in your computer is slowly going bad.  It could continue to work for years but that is a sign of it.

2014-12-16 20:43:04	seebs	In particular, they work just fine in every way I can test, *except*, the Minecraft server thinks the authentication servers it talks to are unavailable.

2014-12-17 20:51:21	lyonsb	Boohbah, please define REST.

2014-12-17 20:51:44	Earnestly	REST has some good ideas, a lot of it is really just common sense

2014-12-17 20:52:26	wasamasa	yes
2014-12-17 20:52:29	localuser-	REST has become a cool word in the business, which kinda sucks.. Because while its great for its intended purposes, its not so great if you try to implement everything using it.
2014-12-17 20:52:30	wasamasa	that is the problem

2014-12-17 20:54:32	lyonsb	Joe Armstrong is implying an aesthetic concern.

I've got some glitches with some desktop effects, like wooble windows. I've tried to change the compositing mode to all of them, but it still is there. Some similar experience with intel graphic card? I've been looking for but I didn't find any related bug

2014-12-18 00:29:49	twistedtruth	ahh yeah he said and arch install. I read it as arch installer
2014-12-18 00:30:01	Earnestly	BaconBacon: Arch is the result of LFS, in a sense.  You're still very close to `make`, but it's wrapped up in a thin pkgbuild which is very meager compared to full on rpm specs and deb magic.  The code is untained from upstream, much like LFS you download the source code directly.
2014-12-18 00:30:21	Earnestly	BaconBacon: Compared to stuff like gentoo which is very far abstracted away from `make`, use flags for example

You quite honestly just run your `make DESTDIR=foo/ install` yourself, a .PKGINFO looks like: http://sprunge.us/DhPI (basic key value pair) and you generate an mtree via: `bsdtar -czf .MTREE --format mtree --options='!all,use-set,type,uid,gid,mode,time,size,md5,sha256,link' .PKGINFO foo/

2014-12-19 01:36:04	JohnBobSmith	instead of banging head against wall trying to get sliding on walls working, I've decided to continue working on Hungry Human in other areas. The problem I now face is this: How can one remove a struct after its been created? Like if I have struct Item {int value}; and then do Item sandwich01; how to remove the sandwich01???

2014-12-19 19:23:19	Centime	Hi. I have a new laptop, bought with no OS since I've been an (arch)linux user for some years now. The thing is, when it boots, instead of the familiar BIOS, i'm facing the EFI Shell. from the wiki I read that I should use bcfg to boot from my usb, but the command isn't found... Anyone knows how to deal with EFI ?

Until you realise that it's a big, big world and your 'freedom' if you aren't careful suddenly starts impinging on someone else's 'freedom'. It's all about restraint and respect for others. Sure if you *have* to swear sometimes then go ahead, feel free. just understand that when you so you are paying for it in someone else's 'freedom' not to have to hear it. 'Freedom' is never as simple as it

2014-12-20 00:49:18	Earnestly	You rely on a useful property of fontconfig, where with `fc-cache -s`, it will only scan system directories; thus for any given update you just have to check if there are any files in a system directory

2014-12-20 00:51:27	sudokode	there you'd deliver the list of packages with the hook 'font' after the transaction, and in that case, you'd get one big fc-cache call

2014-12-20 00:52:55	Earnestly	keenerd: Because fontconfig will not look there and unless a user *explicitly* asks fontconfig to do so, you should not be calling fc-cache

2014-12-20 00:53:23	sudokode	it could be though...
2014-12-20 00:53:28	sudokode	you're thinking too inside the arch
2014-12-20 00:54:06	sudokode	you make /usr/lib/pacman.d/hooks for hooks provided by arch and /etc/pacman.d/hooks for hooks created by users
2014-12-20 00:54:09	sudokode	similar to systemd
2014-12-20 00:54:46	Earnestly	So you've simply made unreliable, crude hooks.  Fair enough, anyone can do that.
2014-12-20 00:54:48	sudokode	you could easily make something to override the font hook or even something to extend it for fonts grabbed from outside of arch

2014-12-22 18:50:56	lawren	for me the combination of rules for my usual apps, and tags is that a single keypress brings exactly the application i want to the master of my current view. One might say, well, I open each individual app on a workspace, so I know what it is. But what if I want to quickly see tags 2 and 7, well I can do that too, and then get back to .. whatever view I had before. Does that even make sense :)

2014-12-23 21:04:15	carutsu	hey I'm having quite a hard time installing arch linux (never had any issues before) the error I get is that it cannot create a fs since it seems it is in use. I can assure you it is not. This is an xps15 with that weird intel hybrid technology. I have the issue even though I disabled it
2014-12-23 21:04:46	carutsu	the wiki doesnt seem to have a section on this and my google fu has failed me, any ideas?
2014-12-23 21:05:20	tb01110100	I've configured dmix as per the wiki's instructions, but alsa still seems unable to play sound from more than one program at a time, and my google fu has failed me, any ideas?

2014-12-26 15:28:22	Earnestly	thrice: The issue with wpa_supplicant being regarded as hard is the lack of good documentation; there's also very little practical advice because everyone uses the wrappers provided and like a bootloader, once it works, you leave it the hell alone and never learn more about it.

2014-12-26 15:31:48	Earnestly	thrice: And if the interface to wpa_supplicant is bad, (or wpa_cli), then we should improve that, make it better.  E.g. wpa_cli could take multiple things at once, e.g. `add_network "foobar" passphrase "bazqux"` instead of two.  *shrug*

It's telling me that I can't overwrite things in the /usr/ directory, which makes sense.

2014-12-26 15:59:27	poeticrpm	you can install AUR packages by building them using makepkg, then installing the resulting package with pacman -U. Your goal on Arch is always to use pacman to install something to the system. If not that and you have to compile from source, either create a PKGBUILD for it, or install it locally to your home folder and run it from there

2014-12-26 20:34:20	eggless	Just bought a thinkpad yoga 14. Has a hybrid HDD + 16 GB SSD. I want to dual boot arch if possible. Windoze uses the ssd for caching, but I would like to install a root partition there for arch and use the 1TB HDD for the rest. Two questins about putting arch on the ssd: (1) Is 16 GB enough for the root partition? (2) Will this break windows, which uses the ssd for caching? Anyone have experience with this setup?
2014-12-26 20:34:49	NanoSector	1, yes. 2, disable/remove caching in windows first and you should be fine.
2014-12-26 20:34:51	autrilla	Oh, by the way, to all dual booters, be careful with windows and btrfs

2014-12-27 01:13:38	Tom^	Arch-TK: from what i understand LC_COLLATE also changes the way some things are ordered
2014-12-27 01:13:42	satty	Arch-TK: I installed arch and then gnome desktop , battery monitor always shows estimating
2014-12-27 01:13:43	Arch-TK	ah I give up.
2014-12-27 01:13:52	froz3nfl0w	Tom^: I can see the benefits of writing pseudo random data to the partition before encrypting. do you know the benefit gained writing pseudo randomly to a temp container as opposed to the actual device, as the wiki and 5.3 of that FAQ suggest?
2014-12-27 01:14:14	Tom^	Arch-TK: changing ls ordering etc
2014-12-27 01:14:17	Arch-TK	Tom^: Yes, like ls results.
2014-12-27 01:14:26	Arch-TK	I like my ls results the way they are right now.

2014-12-27 01:15:01	Arch-TK	The point I was mainly making is that the guy who came here for help, cyberjar09, definitely only needed to be informed that he needs to put LANG= in his locale.conf
2014-12-27 01:15:04	Tom^	Arch-TK: :p

I've used xrandr to change the dpi, and that makes i3 look great, but xterm's font is insanely small.  is it just a matter of using a larger font in xterm and whatever other applications use small, bitmapped fonts?

2014-12-29 17:36:28	Earnestly	grawity: (Mostly because dpi is part of point size calculation whereas graphics don't seem to take dpi into account in part of their size algorithms, which is a problem really.)

2014-12-29 19:37:56	Reventlov	sigh.
2014-12-29 19:38:01	Namarrgon	godel: you have to recompile it against the new lib but you have to update pacman for that first
2014-12-29 19:38:13	gehidore	ugh yaourt
2014-12-29 19:38:17	azaki	projectmonarch, there seems to be a weird trade-off in the linux world, where the "user friendly distros", have too many magic scripts, that are designed to make things "easier", but the problem is all this "magic" only works when it works, if that makes sense.. when it fails, it's actually *harder* to figure out how to fix it, than on a distro like arch.

2014-12-29 21:19:04	svexican	Hi, all! what's your opinion on NFS? (any recommended alternatives? i'm only using it with other *nix's)
2014-12-29 21:19:04	switchy	rsa uses big ol' primes, ecdsa uses elliptic curve magicien_ 
2014-12-29 21:19:33	sudokode	rsa uses primes that were given to them by the US government... who probably figured out the relationship between the primes already
2014-12-29 21:19:37	sudokode	so rsa is essentially broken
