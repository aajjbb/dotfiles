2014-12-11 17:04:59	zagabar	Hello. I wanted to enable multilib but instead of only uncommenting the [multilib] section i also uncommented the [multilib-testing] section, and then ran pacman -Syu. I then realised the mistake, cancelled and commented out [multilib-testing] but leaving [multilib] still on, and rthen ran pacman -Syu fine. However, now when I try to install steam from AUR which needs some 32 lib stuff, I am getting errors
2014-12-11 17:05:02	zagabar	like: "target not found: lib32-libindicator" and google tells me that I need to enable multilib, which I already have, so is it possible that my brief uncommenting of multilib-testing broke something?

2014-12-11 22:02:04	halosghost	Earnestly: one of my favorite examples: snprintf() takes a size_t for number of bytes to write but returns an int for number of bytes written

2014-12-11 22:02:10	sudokode	that's only available in Sahmot++
2014-12-11 22:02:14	Earnestly	It's actually pretty hard, so while those books are good at describing the language, you just have to be mindful

Doing that is a bad hack anyway: if it works it means that something in your computer is slowly going bad.  It could continue to work for years but that is a sign of it.

2014-12-16 20:43:04	seebs	In particular, they work just fine in every way I can test, *except*, the Minecraft server thinks the authentication servers it talks to are unavailable.

2014-12-17 20:51:21	lyonsb	Boohbah, please define REST.
2014-12-17 20:51:32	wasamasa	"Representational state transfer (REST) is an abstraction of the architecture of the World Wide Web; more precisely, REST is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system."

2014-12-17 20:51:44	Earnestly	REST has some good ideas, a lot of it is really just common sense

2014-12-17 20:52:26	wasamasa	yes
2014-12-17 20:52:29	localuser-	REST has become a cool word in the business, which kinda sucks.. Because while its great for its intended purposes, its not so great if you try to implement everything using it.
2014-12-17 20:52:30	wasamasa	that is the problem
2014-12-17 20:52:31	Boohbah	the definition is not a great one, but the concepts are useful

2014-12-17 20:54:32	lyonsb	Joe Armstrong is implying an aesthetic concern.

I've got some glitches with some desktop effects, like wooble windows. I've tried to change the compositing mode to all of them, but it still is there. Some similar experience with intel graphic card? I've been looking for but I didn't find any related bug

2014-12-18 00:29:49	twistedtruth	ahh yeah he said and arch install. I read it as arch installer
2014-12-18 00:30:01	Earnestly	BaconBacon: Arch is the result of LFS, in a sense.  You're still very close to `make`, but it's wrapped up in a thin pkgbuild which is very meager compared to full on rpm specs and deb magic.  The code is untained from upstream, much like LFS you download the source code directly.
2014-12-18 00:30:21	Earnestly	BaconBacon: Compared to stuff like gentoo which is very far abstracted away from `make`, use flags for example

You quite honestly just run your `make DESTDIR=foo/ install` yourself, a .PKGINFO looks like: http://sprunge.us/DhPI (basic key value pair) and you generate an mtree via: `bsdtar -czf .MTREE --format mtree --options='!all,use-set,type,uid,gid,mode,time,size,md5,sha256,link' .PKGINFO foo/
