2015-06-21 19:27:13	phresh	i dont think this is the problem but i can check again what was this 2 .so file
2015-06-21 19:27:14	+halosghost	does it come with an uninstall command?

2015-06-21 19:27:36	phresh	just a minute
2015-06-21 19:27:47	+halosghost	if it doesn't, you should strongly consider manually removing everything it installed

2015-06-21 19:31:06	phresh	no. :( waht is it?
2015-06-21 19:31:25	+halosghost	the AUR is a collection of build scripts to build packages for Arch Linux even if they are not officially supported
2015-06-21 19:32:03	+halosghost	in many cases, installing a package from the AUR is as simple as downloading the tarball from the AUR, extracting it, reviewing the build files and then running `makepkg -si`
2015-06-21 19:32:56	sd1001	And now you can just `git clone` instead of downloading and extracting \o/

2015-06-21 19:33:29	+halosghost	yeah

2015-06-21 19:33:48	+halosghost	any who though
2015-06-21 19:33:59	+halosghost	point is, you should get the package tarball from the AUR and review it
2015-06-21 19:34:05	+halosghost	if it looks safe, install that
2015-06-21 19:34:11	+halosghost	if not, rewrite the PKGBUILD yourself

2015-06-21 19:37:46	+halosghost	then you'll need to manually remove them until it installs correctly

2015-06-21 19:49:38	+halosghost	phresh: it's okay if you don't completely understand them, but you should try
2015-06-21 19:49:59	ru57y	halosghost: so the right way is with AUR ?
2015-06-21 19:50:28	+halosghost	ru57y: you should, if you have not, learn to use the AUR manually (download the tarball, extract, review, run `makepkg`)
2015-06-21 19:50:39	+halosghost	ru57y: after you are familiar with the process, consider something like `cower`
2015-06-21 19:50:51	+halosghost	ru57y: once you feel completely at home with it, it's probably fine for you to consider higher-level tools
2015-06-21 19:51:01	+halosghost	ru57y: but, again, learning how everything works is a necessary piece of Arch
2015-06-21 19:51:58	ru57y	halosghost: thank you very much !
2015-06-21 19:52:02	+halosghost	ru57y: happy to help
2015-06-21 19:52:35	kartug	halosghost: hey mate, jsut wondering what your thoughts are on cower? I've been installing AUR packages the 'official' way, but found updating them with yaourt realy helpful. just did somemore reading and came across cower
2015-06-21 19:52:37	+halosghost	ru57y: also note that by avoiding tools like yaourt and the like, you will manage to avoid issues where pacman updates break the tool
2015-06-21 19:52:49	+halosghost	kartug: I love and adore cower
2015-06-21 19:53:13	phresh	sry
2015-06-21 19:53:14	+halosghost	kartug: and I strongly prefer it to yaourt and alternatives like pacaur
2015-06-21 19:53:16	+halosghost	phresh: for what?
2015-06-21 19:53:17	phresh	i dont know
2015-06-21 19:53:21	+halosghost	…
2015-06-21 19:53:24	+halosghost	oh
2015-06-21 19:53:26	kartug	halosghost: guess its time for another switch then :p
2015-06-21 19:53:27	phresh	its an code
2015-06-21 19:53:28	+halosghost	you don't understand the files, that's okay
2015-06-21 19:53:55	+halosghost	phresh: the moral of the story is that the PKGBUILD is a shell script (following a particular set of guidelines) that tells makepkg how to generate a pacakge from the source files
2015-06-21 19:54:04	+halosghost	phresh: the .install file adds some extra steps
2015-06-21 19:54:05	phresh	its a code.. i dont know what need i take
2015-06-21 19:54:33	+halosghost	phresh: at some point, consider reading `man PKGBUILD` and `man makepkg`
2015-06-21 19:54:34	phresh	so.. i run the PKGBUILD file?
2015-06-21 19:54:39	+halosghost	phresh: but, for now, just run `makepkg -s`
2015-06-21 19:55:19	phresh	running
2015-06-21 19:55:38	phresh	usr/bin/makepkg: sor: 199: fakeroot
2015-06-21 19:55:47	phresh	need sudo?
2015-06-21 19:56:00	+halosghost	no
2015-06-21 19:56:05	+halosghost	don't ever run makepkg as sudo
2015-06-21 19:56:13	phresh	ok
2015-06-21 19:56:18	+halosghost	but it sounds like you didn't install base-devel when you installed arch
2015-06-21 19:56:28	+halosghost	so, install base-devel with pacman
