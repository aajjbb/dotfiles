Find file quickly in current project

You can use M-x pde-project-find-file to find the file in current
project, that means the command will search recursively in the top
directory. If you project is not two large, this won't take a long
time to build the full file list. When you add some files, you can
use C-u M-x pde-project-find-file to update the cache. If you think
the command is useful, you can bind a global key, I recommend use
C-x C-p which original binding is `mark-page'. I seldom use that
command. So add this to you .emacs:

  (global-set-key "\C-x\C-p" 'pde-project-find-file)
