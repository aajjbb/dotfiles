Major mode for editing OCaml code.

Dedicated to Emacs and XEmacs, version 21 and higher.  Provides
automatic indentation and compilation interface. Performs font/color
highlighting using Font-Lock.  It is designed for OCaml but handles
Caml Light as well.

The Font-Lock minor-mode is used according to your customization
options.

You have better byte-compile tuareg.el.

For customization purposes, you should use `tuareg-mode-hook'
\(run for every file) or `tuareg-load-hook' (run once) and not patch
the mode itself. You should add to your configuration file something like:
  (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
               ... ; your customization code
            ))
For example you can change the indentation of some keywords, the
`electric' flags, Font-Lock colors... Every customizable variable is
documented, use `C-h-v' or look at the mode's source code.

`dot-emacs.el' is a sample customization file for standard changes.
You can append it to your `.emacs' or use it as a tutorial.

`M-x ocamldebug' FILE starts the OCaml debugger ocamldebug on the executable
FILE, with input and output in an Emacs buffer named *ocamldebug-FILE*.

A Tuareg Interactive Mode to evaluate expressions in a toplevel is included.
Type `M-x tuareg-run-ocaml' or see special-keys below.

For the best indentation experience, some elementary rules must be followed.
  - Because the `function' keyword has a special indentation (to handle
    case matches) use the `fun' keyword when no case match is performed.
  - In OCaml, `;;' is no longer necessary for correct indentation,
    except before top level phrases not introduced by `type', `val', `let'
    etc. (i.e., phrases used for their side-effects or to be executed
    in a top level.)
  - Long sequences of `and's may slow down indentation slightly, since
    some computations (few) require to go back to the beginning of the
    sequence. Some very long nested blocks may also lead to slow
    processing of `end's, `else's, `done's...
  - Multiline strings are handled properly, but you may prefer string
    concatenation `^' to break long strings (the C-j keystroke can help).
  - Comment indentation is often a matter of taste and context, yet
    sophisticated heuristics provide reasonable indentation in most cases.
    When inserting a comment right before the code it refers to, it is
    generally expected that this comment will be aligned with the folowing
    code; to enforce this, leave a blank line before the comment.

Known bugs:
  - When writing a line with mixed code and comments, avoid putting
    comments at the beginning or middle of the text. More precisely,
    writing comments immediately after `=' or parentheses then writing
    some more code on the line leads to indentation errors. You may write
    `let x (* blah *) = blah' but should avoid `let x = (* blah *) blah'.
